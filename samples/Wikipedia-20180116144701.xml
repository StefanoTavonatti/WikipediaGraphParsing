A '''pizza cutter''' (also known as a '''roller blade''' or a '''pizza wheel''') is a [[tool|utensil]] that is used to cut [[pizza]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Murray|title=101 Knife Designs: Practical Knives for Daily Use|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sOjBvs3I29EC&amp;pg=PA22|date=25 June 2013|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-3383-8|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
There are two main types of pizza cutters.
The most common uses a wheel that rotates in a circle while a person moves the cutter in a direction that they would like to cut the pizza.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter2013&quot;/&gt; The other type is a large curved knife called a [[mezzaluna]] (Italian for &quot;half moon&quot;), which is rocked back and forth to cut the pizza. These two types of pizza cutters come in many different sizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosso1985&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosso|first=Julee|title=The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=roluySsfCKQC&amp;pg=PA199|date=January 1985|publisher=Workman Pub.|isbn=978-0-89480-831-9|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people might use the wheel pizza cutter for other things, including [[craft]] work. Some types of [[mezzaluna]]s (particularly the double-bladed type) are often used to mince herbs or chop vegetables.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosso1985&quot;/&gt;

{{pizza}}

A '''pizza saver''' or '''package saver''' (sometimes referred to as pizza table, pizza Ottoman, or pizza nipple) is an object used to prevent the top of a food container, such as a [[pizza box]] or [[cake box]], from collapsing in at the center and touching the food inside.&lt;ref name=petroski&gt;Henry Petroski. [http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/4/a-round-pie-in-a-square-box/1 &quot;A Round Pie in a Square Box&quot;], ''[[American Scientist]]'', July–August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A [[pizza]] saver is made of plastic and has three (sometimes four) legs. They are often white, and the common practice is to place one pizza saver in the center of the pizza before the box lid is closed for [[pizza delivery|delivery]]. The pizza saver is not re-used and is typically discarded by the patron, although some people have found secondary uses for them &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sewmanyways.blogspot.co.at/2011/06/tool-time-tuesdayrecycled-pizza-box.html|title=Tool Time Tuesday...Recycled Pizza Box Support|website=Sewmanyways.blogspot.co.at|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as egg holders when turned upside down.&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt;

In 1985, Carmela Vitale of [[Dix Hills, New York]], was issued a [[patent]] for a plastic 3-legged tripod stool that would sit in the middle of the box and keep the top from sagging into pizza, cakes or other foods kept in a box.&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt; Vitale called her invention a &quot;package saver&quot; and used that term also as the title of her patent, but it has since been renamed the &quot;pizza saver&quot; since that has become its most common use.&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt; The patent (#4,498,586) was filed on February 10, 1983, and issued on February 12, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| inventor-last = Vitale | inventor-first = Carmela | issue-date = 1985 | title = Package saver| country-code = US  | patent-number = 4498586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patent for a similar device, named &quot;Guardapizza&quot;, was filed in 1974 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, by Claudio Daniel Troglia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://portaltramites.inpi.gob.ar/consultasmodelos/Modelos_Resultado?Va=24980&amp;Vb=O&amp;Vc=07] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitiosargentina.com.ar/se-llama-guardapizza-aqui-historia/|title=Se llama guardapizza, aquí su historia|date=1 August 2017|website=Sitiosargentina.com.ar|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations on the device have since been invented by other people, such as a disposable plastic spatula whose handle holds the box top up; and a plastic tripod, like the designs by Vitale and Troglia, but with one of the legs serrated like a knife, making for easy cutting of stuck cheese and bread. &lt;ref name=petroski/&gt;  Some pizzerias have eliminated the use of plastic pizza savers by returning to the old method of simply baking a bread ball into the center of their pizzas.

{{Canadian cuisine}}

'''Pizza-ghetti''' is a [[combination meal]] commonly found in [[fast food]] or [[family restaurants]] throughout the province of [[Quebec]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/encyclopaedia!openframeset&amp;frame=Right&amp;Src=/edible.nsf/pages/pizzaghetti!opendocument Pizzaghetti] description on ''Practically Edible: Web Food Encyclopaedia''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanphoto.net/blog/category/food/ Pizza-ghetti]: a staple item on fast-food menus in Montreal&lt;/ref&gt; and other parts of [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therecord.com/entertainment/dining/dining_375.html Pizza-ghetti in a family restaurant in Waterloo, Ontario], ''Waterloo Region Record'', 13 December 2006. Retrieved on 11 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of a [[pizza]], sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of [[spaghetti]] with a tomato based sauce.  Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of [[Italian cuisine]], combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thewaffle.blog.com/2009/12/18/what-pizzaghetti-was-really-meant-to-be/], ''What Pizzaghetti was meant to be.''. Retrieved on 22 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, especially in the United States, ''pizza-ghetti'' refers to a home-made spaghetti dish cooked with the basic ingredients of a pizza, such as tomato sauce and olives, but without a pizza crust. The mixture may be cooked in a pot or baked in an oven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recipezaar.com/Pepperoni-Pizzaghetti-24984 Crustless pizza-ghetti in a pot]: recipe from the United States&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recettes.qc.ca/livre/recette.php?id=146994 Baked crustless pizza-ghetti]: recipe from Quebec {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pizza proof without words.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Proof without words]] for 8 sectors by {{harvtxt|Carter|Wagon|1994a}}.]]
In elementary [[geometry]], the '''pizza theorem''' states the equality of two areas that arise when one partitions a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] in a certain way.

Let ''p'' be an interior point of the disk, and let ''n'' be a number that is divisible by four and greater than or equal to eight. Form ''n'' sectors of the disk with equal angles by choosing an arbitrary line through ''p'', rotating the line {{nowrap|{{sfrac|''n''|2}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1}} times by an angle of {{sfrac|2{{pi}}|''n''}} [[radian]]s, and slicing the disk on each of the resulting {{sfrac|''n''|2}} lines. Number the sectors consecutively in a clockwise or anti-clockwise fashion. Then the pizza theorem states that:

:'' The sum of the areas of the odd numbered sectors equals the sum of the areas of the even numbered sectors'' {{harv|Upton|1968}}.

The pizza theorem is so called because it mimics a traditional [[pizza]] slicing technique. It shows that, if two people share a pizza sliced in this way by taking alternating slices, then they each get an equal amount of pizza.

==History==
The pizza theorem was originally proposed as a challenge problem by {{harvtxt|Upton|1968}}. The published solution to this problem, by Michael Goldberg, involved direct manipulation of the algebraic expressions for the areas of the sectors.
{{harvtxt|Carter|Wagon|1994a}} provide an alternative proof by [[Dissection puzzle|dissection]]. They show how to partition the sectors into smaller pieces so that each piece in an odd-numbered sector has a [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] piece in an even-numbered sector, and vice versa. {{harvtxt|Frederickson|2012}} gave a family of dissection proofs for all cases (in which the number of sectors {{nowrap|is 8, 12, 16, ...}}).

==Generalizations==
[[File:Pizza theorem2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|12 sectors: green area = orange area]]
The requirement that the number of sectors be a multiple of four is necessary: as [[Don Coppersmith]] showed, dividing a disk into four sectors, or a number of sectors that is not divisible by four, does not in general produce equal areas. {{harvtxt|Mabry|Deiermann|2009}} answered a problem of {{harvtxt|Carter|Wagon|1994b}} by providing a more precise version of the theorem that determines which of the two sets of sectors has greater area in the cases that the areas are unequal. Specifically, if the number of sectors is 2 (mod 8) and no slice passes through the center of the disk, then the subset of slices containing the center has smaller area than the other subset, while if the number of sectors is 6 (mod 8) and no slice passes through the center, then the subset of slices containing the center has larger area. An odd number of sectors is not possible with straight-line cuts, and a slice through the center causes the two subsets to be equal regardless of the number of sectors.

{{harvtxt|Mabry|Deiermann|2009}} also observe that, when the pizza is divided evenly, then so is its crust (the crust may be interpreted as either the perimeter of the disk or the area between the boundary of the disk and a smaller circle having the same center, with the cut-point lying in the latter's interior), and since the disks bounded by both circles are partitioned evenly so is their difference. However, when the pizza is divided unevenly, the diner who gets the most pizza area actually gets the least crust.

As {{harvtxt|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|1999}} note, an equal division of the pizza also leads to an equal division of its toppings, as long as each topping is distributed in a disk (not necessarily concentric with the whole pizza) that contains the central point ''p'' of the division into sectors.

==Related results==
{{harvtxt|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|1999}} show that a pizza sliced in the same way as the pizza theorem, into a number ''n'' of sectors with equal angles where ''n'' is divisible by four, can also be shared equally among ''n''/4 people. For instance, a pizza divided into 12 sectors can be shared equally by three people as well as by two; however, to accommodate all five of the Hirschhorns, a pizza would need to be divided into 20 sectors.

{{harvtxt|Cibulka|Kynčl|Mészáros|Stolař|2010}} and {{harvtxt|Knauer|Micek|Ueckerdt|2011}} study the [[game theory]] of choosing free slices of pizza in order to guarantee a large share, a problem posed by Dan Brown and [[Peter Winkler]]. In the version of the problem they study, a pizza is sliced radially (without the guarantee of equal-angled sectors) and two diners alternately choose pieces of pizza that are adjacent to an already-eaten sector. If the two diners both try to maximize the amount of pizza they eat, the diner who takes the first slice can guarantee a 4/9 share of the total pizza, and there exists a slicing of the pizza such that he cannot take more. The [[fair division]] or cake cutting problem considers similar games in which different players have different criteria for how they measure the size of their share; for instance, one diner may prefer to get the most pepperoni while another diner may prefer to get the most cheese.

==See also==
Other mathematical results related to pizza slicing involve the [[lazy caterer's sequence]], a sequence of integers that counts the maximum number of pieces of pizza that one can obtain by a given number of straight slices, and the [[ham sandwich theorem]], a result about slicing three-dimensional objects whose two-dimensional version implies that any pizza, no matter how misshapen, can have its area and its crust length simultaneously bisected by a single carefully chosen straight-line cut.

{{Pizza}}
The '''World Pizza Championship''' is an event held annually to determine the world's best [[pizza]] makers. It began in 1991 and is organized by the magazine ''Pizza e Pasta Italiana'' and PizzaNew.  In 2008, over 20 countries competed Pizzas are judged by preparation, taste, bake and presentation. Pizza competitions include those for fastest pizza maker, freestyle acrobatics and the largest dough stretch. Salsomaggiore Terme ([[Parma]]), [[Italy]], is the site of the championships, although several other cities likewise claim to be the home of the ultimate international pizza games including Naples and Paris.

One of the main attractions to the championship is the presence of [[Miss Italia]] (Miss Italy), who crowns the winning pizzaiolos.  It is the worlds largest pizza show in the world with over 6,500 independent chain and franchise owners from all around the world attending. The winners are inducted into the Pizza Hall of Fame and are sometimes invited back to judge the next World Pizza Championship. They also win a cash prize totaling to no more than about $10,000. They have different categories like best Vegetarian Pizza, best Meat pizza, etc. At the end of the competition, the best pizza overall is selected. Whoever wins not only receives the great incentives but also receives free marketing for themselves or for their business. The business or business owner will receive a plaque to be hung and bragging rights that they won the biggest pizza competition in the world. One of the biggest names is Tony Gemignani who has won the championship many times.

'''Pizza''' is a traditional [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] [[Dish (food)|dish]] consisting of a yeasted [[flatbread]] typically topped with [[tomato sauce]] and [[cheese]] and baked in an oven. It can also be topped with additional vegetables, meats, and [[condiments]]. 

The term ''pizza'' was first recorded in the 10th century, in a Latin manuscript from the [[Southern Italy]] town of [[Gaeta]] in [[Lazio]], on the border with Campania.&lt;ref name=MartinMaiden/&gt; Modern pizza was invented in [[Naples]], and the dish and its variants have since become popular and common in many areas of the world.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Hanna|title=American Pie|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/american-pie|publisher=American Heritage Magazine|accessdate=4 May 2012|date=April–May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, upon [[Italy]]'s request, [[Neapolitan pizza]] was registered with the [[European Union]] as a [[Traditional Speciality Guaranteed]] dish.&lt;ref&gt;Official Journal of the European Union, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:034:0007:0016:EN:PDF Commission regulation (EU) No 97/2010], 5 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Trademark Association, [http://www.inta.org/INTABulletin/Pages/EUROPEANUNIONPIZZANAPOLETANAObtainsTraditionalSpecialityGuaranteedStatus.aspx European Union: Pizza napoletana obtains &quot;Traditional Speciality Guaranteed&quot; status], 1 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana'' (True Neapolitan Pizza Association), a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples, aims to &quot;promote and protect... the true Neapolitan pizza&quot;.&lt;ref name=AVPN&gt;{{cite web|title=Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN)|url=http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/eng_chisiamo.php|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizza is one of the most popular foods in the world and common [[fast food]] item in Europe and North America. Many independent or chain restaurants, cafes, and fast food outlets offer pizza. Restaurants or chains specializing in pizza are [[pizzeria]]s. [[Pizza delivery]] is common in some parts of the world.

Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, either whole or in portions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baofu 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Baofu | first=P. | title=The Future of Post-Human Culinary Art: Towards a New Theory of Ingredients and Techniques | publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publisher | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-4438-4484-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7QwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA281 | page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various types of ovens are used to cook them and many varieties exist. Several similar dishes are prepared from ingredients commonly used in pizza preparation, such as [[calzone]] and [[Stromboli (food)|stromboli]]. In the United States, pizza is usually [[finger food|eaten out of hand]] after dividing into slices from a large pizza or small [[pizzetta]] as a whole. In Italy, pizza is eaten with a fork and knife in restaurants, but is also sold to take away and eaten out of hand. [[Frozen food|Frozen]] pizza became popular in the late 20th century.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pizza&quot; ({{IPA-it|ˈpittsa|lang}}) first appeared in a Latin text from the [[southern Italy]] town of [[Gaeta]], then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta ''duodecim pizze'' (&quot;twelve pizzas&quot;) every [[Christmas|Christmas Day]], and another twelve every [[Easter Sunday]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=MartinMaiden&gt;{{cite web |first=Martin |last=Maiden |website=yourDictionary.com |title=Linguistic Wonders Series: Pizza is a German(ic) Word |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/pizza.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030115224054/http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/pizza.html |archivedate=2003-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Salvatore Riciniello (1987) ''Codice Diplomatico Gaetano'', Vol. I, La Poligrafica&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggested etymologies include:
*  [[Byzantine Greek]] and [[Late Latin]] ''pitta'' &gt; ''pizza,'' ''cf.'' Modern Greek [[pita|pitta]] bread and the Apulia and Calabrian (then [[Catepanate of Italy|Byzantine Italy]]) ''pitta,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Babiniotis |first=Georgios |date=2005 |title=Λεξικό της Νέας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας |trans-title=[[Dictionary of Modern Greek]] |language=el |publisher=Lexicology Centre |isbn=960-86190-1-7 |page=1413}}&lt;/ref&gt; a round flat bread baked in the oven at high temperature sometimes with toppings. The word ''pitta'' can in turn be traced to either [[Ancient Greek]] πικτή (''pikte''), &quot;fermented pastry&quot;, which in Latin became &quot;picta&quot;, or Ancient Greek πίσσα (''pissa'', [[Attic dialect|Attic]] πίττα, ''pitta''), &quot;pitch&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pizza |title=''Pizza'', at Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2383267 |title=''Pissa'', Liddell and Scott, &quot;A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''pḗtea'', &quot;bran&quot; (''pētítēs'', &quot;bran bread&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=pizza&amp;r=66 |title=''Pizza'', at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foods similar to pizza have been made since the [[neolithic age]]. Records of people adding other ingredients to [[bread]] to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] supplemented their bread with [[vegetable oil|oils]], herbs, and cheese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Talati-Padiyar|first1=Dhwani|title=Travelled, Tasted, Tried &amp; Tailored: Food Chronicles|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c0wiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67|isbn=1304961354|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Buonassisi, Rosario|title=Pizza: From its Italian Origins to the Modern Table|year=2000|publisher=Firefly|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 6th century BC, the soldiers in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] King [[Darius I]]'s armies baked flatbreads with cheese and [[date (fruit)|date]]s on top of their battle shields.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Pizza, A Slice of American History&quot; Liz Barrett (2014), p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Science of Bakery Products&quot; W. P. Edwards (2007), p.199&lt;/ref&gt; An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the [[Aeneid]], when Celaeno, queen of the [[Harpies]], foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, [[Aeneas]] and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables.

Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in [[Naples, Italy|Naples]] in the 18th or early 19th century.&lt;ref name=Helstosky21&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helstosky|first1=Carol|title=Pizza: A Global History|date=2008|publisher=Reaktion|location=London|isbn=1-86189-391-4|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Prior to that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, cheese, and basil. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims.&lt;ref name=Helstosky21 /&gt; Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries, and pizzerias keep this old tradition alive today. 

A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, ''[[pizza Margherita]]'', was invented in 1889, when the [[Palace of Capodimonte|Royal Palace of Capodimonte]] commissioned the Neapolitan [[wikt:pizzaiolo|pizzaiolo]] (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting [[Margherita of Savoy|Queen Margherita]]. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pizza Margherita: History and Recipe | url = http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy-featured/recipes/pizza-margherita-history-and-recipe | work = Italy Magazine | date = 14 March 2011 | accessdate = 23 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although recent research casts doubt on this legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Was margherita pizza really named after Italy's queen? | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/0/20515123 | work = BBC Food | date = 28 December 2012 | accessdate = 31 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizza was brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helstosky|first1=Carol|title=Pizza: A Global History|date=2008|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-630-8|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants concentrated.

==Preparation==
[[File:USMC-03074.jpg|thumb|Eating of pizza]]
Pizza is prepared fresh, [[Frozen food|frozen]], and as portion-size slices or pieces. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.

Another form of uncooked pizza is available from [[take and bake pizzeria]]s. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold to customers to bake in their own [[Conventional ovens|ovens]]. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to complete at home before baking in an oven.

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Cooking===
In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a [[conveyor belt]] oven or, in the case of more expensive restaurants, a wood- or coal-fired [[masonry oven|brick oven]]. On deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a [[peel (tool)|peel]], and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum). Prior to use, a peel may be sprinkled with cornmeal to allow pizza to easily slide onto and off of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmI2YJ1vMxMC&amp;pg=PA3 | title=Make Great Pizza at Home | publisher=Taste of America Press | author=Owens, Martin J. | year=2003 | pages=3 | isbn=0-9744470-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When made at home, it can be baked on a [[pizza stone]] in a regular oven to reproduce the effect of a brick oven. Another option is [[grilled pizza]], in which the crust is baked directly on a barbecue grill. [[Greek pizza]], like Chicago-style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.

When it comes to preparation, the dough and ingredients can be combined on any kind of table. With [[mass production]] of pizzas the process can be completely automated. Most restaurants still use standard and purpose built pizza preparation tables. Pizzerias nowadays can even opt for hi tech pizza preparation tables that combine mass production elements with traditional techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automated pizza preparation table|url=http://rotopizza.club/|publisher=rotopizza.club|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crust===
[[File:Hot pizza.jpg|thumb|A pizza just removed from an oven, with a close-up view of the ''cornicione'' (the outer edge)]]

The bottom of the pizza, called the &quot;crust&quot;, may vary widely according to style—thin as in a typical hand-tossed [[Neapolitan pizza]], or thick as in a deep-dish [[Chicago-style pizza|Chicago-style]]. It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the ''cornicione''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braimbridge|first1=Sophie |last2=Glynn|first2=Joanne |title=Food of Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXUkqkBA-DkC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2005|publisher=Murdoch Books|isbn=978-1-74045-464-3|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often pizza dough contains sugar, both to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeAngelis|first=Dominick A.|title=The Art of Pizza Making: Trade Secrets and Recipes|date=December 1, 2011|publisher=The Creative Pizza Company|isbn=0-9632034-0-1|pages=20–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less expensive [[processed cheese]]s or [[cheese analogue]]s have been developed for [[mass-market]] pizzas to produce desirable qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and stable [[shelf life]]. This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of [[vegetable oil]], manufacturing and culture processes, [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] whey proteins and other changes in manufacture. In 1997 it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was {{convert|1|e6t|short ton|abbr=off}} in the U.S. and {{convert|100000|t|short ton|abbr=off}} in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Cheese Science |last=Fox |first=Patrick F.; () |year=2000 |publisher=Aspen Pub |location= |isbn=0-8342-1260-9 |page=482 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oRp5VCVTQQC&amp;pg=PA482&amp;dq=pizza+cheese |accessdate= |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common toppings for pizza in the United States include ground beef, mushrooms, onions, [[pepperoni]], pineapple, garlic, olives, peppers, carrots, tomatoes, spinach, anchovies, chicken, bacon, ham and sausage. Distinct regional types developed in the twentieth century, including [[California-style pizza|California]], [[Chicago-style pizza|Chicago]], [[Greek pizza|Greek]], [[New Haven-style pizza|New Haven]], [[Detroit-style pizza|Detroit]], [[St. Louis-style pizza|St. Louis]], and [[New York-style pizza|New York]] styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuip.uchicago.edu&quot;/&gt; The first pizzeria in the U.S. was opened in New York's Little Italy in 1905&lt;ref name=&quot;LonelyPlanet&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=New York City 7 |last=Otis |first=Ginger Adams |year=2010 |publisher=Lonely Planet |location= |isbn=1741795915 |page=256 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=btN9Lh8v3OQC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=New+York-style+pizza&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mLG3UMq2LonVigKogoHADg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20York-style%20pizza&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then regions throughout the U.S. offer variations, including deep-dish, stuffed, pockets, turnovers, [[Pizza Rolls|rolled]] and pizza-on-a-stick, each with seemingly limitless combinations of sauce and toppings.

Another variation is grilled pizza, created by taking a fairly thin, round (more typically, irregularly shaped) sheet of yeasted pizza dough, placing it directly over the fire of a grill and then turning it over once the bottom has baked and placing a thin layer of toppings on the baked side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What Can I Bring?

'''Pizza delivery''' is a service in which a [[pizzeria]] or pizza chain [[Delivery (commerce)|delivers]] a [[pizza]] to a customer. An order is typically made either by telephone or over the internet to the pizza chain, in which the customer can request pizza type, size and other products alongside the pizza, commonly including soft drinks. Pizzas may be delivered in pizza boxes or delivery bags, and deliveries are made with either an automobile, [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motorized scooter]], or [[bicycle]]. Customers can, depending on the pizza chain, choose to pay online, or in person, with cash, credit or a debit card. A delivery fee is often charged with what the customer has bought.

==Ordering==
Ordering pizza for delivery usually involves contacting a local pizza restaurant or chain by telephone or online. Online ordering is available in many countries, where some pizza chains offer online menus and ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kretzmann |first=David |url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/2013/12/10/why-dominos-digital-component-is-important/?source=edddlftxt0860001 |title=Why Domino's Digital Component Is Important |publisher=DailyFinance |date= |accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pizza delivery industry has kept pace with technological developments since the 1980s beginning with the rise of the personal computer. Specialized computer software for the pizza delivery business helps determine the most efficient routes for carriers, track exact order and delivery times, manage calls and orders with [[Point of Sale|PoS]] software, and other functions. Since 2008 [[GPS]] tracking technology has been used for real-time monitoring of delivery vehicles by customers over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Kolbasuk McGee. [http://www.informationweek.com/news/206102079 &quot;GPS Comes To High-Tech Pizza-Delivery Tracking&quot;], ''[[InformationWeek]]'', Feb 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pizzerias, such as the [[Ontario]]-based [[Canada|Canadian]] chain [[Pizza Pizza]], will incorporate a guarantee to deliver within a predetermined period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pizzapizza.ca/guarantee.htm|title= Pizza Pizza's Guarantee|format= Commercial website|publisher= pizzapizza.ca|accessdate= 2007-12-07|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071224054617/http://www.pizzapizza.ca/guarantee.htm|archivedate= 2007-12-24|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Domino's Pizza]] had a commercial campaign in the 1980s and early 1990s which guaranteed orders in 30 minutes. The guarantee was for 3 dollars off the order if broken but is often misremembered today as &quot;30 minutes or its free&quot;. This was discontinued in the United States in 1993 due to the number of lawsuits arising from accidents caused by hurried delivery drivers, but is still offered in some countries. Pizzerias with no time guarantee will commonly state to the customer an approximate time frame for a delivery, without making any guarantees as to the actual delivery time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

According to Domino's, [[Super Bowl Sunday]] is the most popular day for its pizza deliveries; others are [[Halloween]], [[New Year's Day]], [[New Year's Eve]], and the day before [[Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dominos19990126&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dominos-pizza-readies-for-record-sales-on-super-bowl-sunday-73513857.html | title=Domino's Pizza Readies for Record Sales on Super Bowl Sunday | publisher=PR Newswire | date=1999-01-26 | accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unscheduled events may also cause an increase in pizza deliveries; for example, Domino's stated that its sales during the O. J. Simpson [[slow-speed chase]] were as large as on Super Bowl Sunday.&lt;ref name=&quot;dp19960122&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-oj-simpson-boosted-dominos-sales-2014-6 | title=How O.J.

===Pizza box===
{{Main|Pizza box}}
[[File:Pizza Funghi mit Pizzahalter.JPG|thumb|Pizza in a box, with a [[pizza saver]] in the middle]]

Modern pizza boxes are made of [[corrugated fiberboard]].&lt;ref name=madrigal&gt;{{Cite news |first=Alexis |last=Madrigal |author-link=Alexis Madrigal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/07/the-3-big-advances-in-the-technology-of-the-pizza-box/242116/ |title=The 3 Big Advances in the Technology of the Pizza Box |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=July 18, 2011 |access-date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrugated board has a number of advantages for pizza delivery: it is cheap, recyclable, and disposable, it is stiff yet light, it is absorbent thus keeping oil and juice from leaking, and the channels of air in the cardboard have excellent insulation properties.&lt;ref name=petroski&gt;{{Cite news |first=Henry |last=Petroski |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/4/a-round-pie-in-a-square-box/1 |title=A Round Pie in a Square Box |work=[[American Scientist]] |date=July–August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the pizza box began in Naples during the 1800s where bakers put pizzas into metal containers called [[stufa]]s: round, vented tin or copper containers with shelves that held the pizzas apart from one another.&lt;ref name=madrigal/&gt; Since the 1940s pizza take-out was done with the pizza sitting on a round cardboard base and covered with a paper bag.&lt;ref name=madrigal/&gt; It is believed Domino's developed the modern corrugated flat square pizza box in the early 1960s, but they never patented it.&lt;ref name=madrigal/&gt; Patent designs for pizza boxes date to at least 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=ZPp0AAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=3484015|title = US Patent 3484015|publisher = Google Patent Search }}&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations since have included various venting configurations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chari |first=Mridula |title=This is the world's best-designed pizza box |url=http://qz.com/170463/this-is-the-worlds-best-designed-pizza-box/ |publisher=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  built-in holders for extra sauces; designs for easier recycling; and perforated tops so wedge-shaped pieces of cardboard can be used as plates.&lt;ref name=madrigal/&gt;&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt;  The lid of the box is often supported by a disposable plastic tripod on top of the pizza known as a [[pizza saver]].

Pizza boxes have a large amount of corrugated fiberboard, individually and in total volume produced each year, but they are not accepted by some municipal [[recycling]] programs because the cardboard is often soaked with grease, making them unsuitable for some forms of recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Granger|first= Trey|url= http://earth911.com/news/2009/02/18/is-food-packaging-really-recyclable/|title= Is Food Packaging Really Recyclable?| publisher= earth911.com|accessdate= 22 January 2013|date=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boxes may thus be commonly thrown away with household [[waste]] into landfills; a more environmentally friendly disposal option that has been proposed is a form of [[compost]]ing for pizza boxes. It is also possible to tear off unstained or unsaturated sections such as the lid and/or sides of the box and recycle those.

===Pizza saver===
{{main|Pizza saver}}

In 1985 Carmela Vitale was issued a patent for a plastic 3-legged tripod stool that would sit in the middle of the box and keep the top from sagging into the pie.&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt; Vitale called her device a &quot;package saver&quot; and used that term also as the title of her patent, but it has since been renamed the &quot;[[pizza saver]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt; Variations on the device have since been invented, such as a disposable plastic spatula whose handle holds the box top up; and a plastic tripod like that made by Vitalie, but with one of the legs serrated like a knife, making for easy cutting of stuck cheese and bread.&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt;

==Employment==
[[File:Pizza Delivery in a College Town Open Late.jpg|alt=|thumb|This pizzeria bills itself as being open late.]]
{{unbalanced|section|date=December 2012}}
In the [[United States]], two labor unions have been formed specifically for pizza delivery drivers: the now-defunct [[Association of Pizza Delivery Drivers]] (APDD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Associated Press|date = 2004-11-18|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6519923/|title = Pizza drivers seek national union|publisher = MSNBC.com|accessdate= 2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Union of Pizza Delivery Drivers]] (AUPDD).&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday092206&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author = Associated Press| date = 2006-09-22|url = https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2006-09-22-pizza-union_x.htm?csp=34|title = Pizza delivery drivers form first union|publisher = ''USA Today'' via usatoday.com|accessdate = 2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

APDD was formed in 2002. Its initial claim to fame was as an Internet-based union, eschewing traditional methods of organizing, and making contributions and the sale of goods the center of its fundraising activities, instead of dues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} People could join APDD using a form at their website, or chat with its officers in an [[IRC]]-compatible [[Java (programming language)|Java]] chat every Tuesday evening. At its peak, it claimed approximately 1,000 members in 46 US states.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} APDD held several certification votes in the US, but was never successful in organizing a local. In March 2006 APDD lost a lawsuit against a Domino's franchise in Mansfield, Ohio. This combined with massive debt left the union with little choice but to shut down.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

AUPDD was founded in early 2006 by Jim Pohle, a driver for a [[Domino's Pizza]] store in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday092206&quot; /&gt; It was certified as the representative union for his store in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aupdd.org/PhotoAlbum.asp |title=Photo Album |format=Organization website |publisher=American Union of Pizza Delivery Drivers |accessdate=2007-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929072257/http://www.aupdd.org/PhotoAlbum.asp |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pohle cites the sub-[[List of U.S. state minimum wages|minimum wage]] paid by his store as the instigating factor in forming a union.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday092206&quot; /&gt;

While formed in the more traditional method of organizing at one's own workplace, AUPDD uses certain Internet-based techniques originated by APDD, such as its mass communications with the press and its fundraising activities (although more traditional dues are collected from the eleven members of the fledgling local).{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} It also uses the Internet as its primary outreach to those wishing to start locals across the US.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Hazards==
[[File:2009-03-20 Papa John's Pizza out for delivery in Durham.jpg|thumb|[[Papa John's Pizza]] delivery]]

Pizza delivery, by its nature, can pose risks for those engaged in it, as they are required to go to the homes of strangers, in unfamiliar neighborhoods. 

In 2004, Pizza Hut fired a delivery driver who shot and killed a robber while on the job, citing its company policy against employees carrying weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 2004-05-18|url =http://www.theindychannel.com/news/3320630/detail.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031093057/http://www.theindychannel.com/news/3320630/detail.html |archivedate=31 October 2004 |title = Deliveryman: I Shot Man In Self-Defense|publisher = The Indy Channel (television news website)|accessdate =1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other national chains such as Domino's and Papa John's also prohibit carrying weapons, though many independent pizzerias allow delivery persons to carry weapons in a legal manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;chan1996&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date = July 16, 2004|url = http://ohioccw.org/200407182215/indiana-arming-delivery-drivers-a-tossup-for-pizzerias.html|title = Arming delivery drivers a tossup for pizzerias|publisher =''Indianapolis Star'' via ohioccw.org (commercial website)|accessdate = 2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employer restrictions on carrying weapons is a controversial issue in the U.S.

===Prank order===
Pizza places may be subject to prank orders for numerous pizzas or to random houses or a target house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't believe your eyes... Pizza delivery men tricked by pranksters ordering food to fake houses|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210778/Dont-believe-eyes--Pizza-delivery-men-tricked-pranksters-ordering-food-fake-houses.html|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prank order may cost businesses money and aggravation, resulting in the restaurant throwing away the unpaid pizzas. For example, in November 2010 in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], a man claiming to be part of [[Bob Dylan]]'s crew placed an order for 148 pizzas which cost nearly $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruno |first=Jackie |title=Amherst police called after pizza prank |url=http://www.wwlp.com/dpp/news/local/hampshire/Amherst-police-called-after-pizza-prank |publisher=WWLP-22News |accessdate=25 October 2012 |date=23 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111235101/http://www.wwlp.com/dpp/news/local/hampshire/Amherst-police-called-after-pizza-prank |archivedate=January 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prank callers have been fined in Singapore for placing false orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Airlines pilot accused of prank fast-food calls |url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=1255b494-dfdf-4af5-99d8-8e6ef00c02a9 |publisher=Canada.com |accessdate=25 October 2012 |date=14 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517212005/http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=1255b494-dfdf-4af5-99d8-8e6ef00c02a9 |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assaults on pizza delivery workers===

Pizza delivery drivers have been subjected to assault, kidnappings, robbery, and have sometimes been raped or killed on the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;chan1996&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Chan|first= Sewell|date =1996-07-10|url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB836951715273632000?mod=googlewsj|title = Pizza Redlining: Green Says 'Go', Red Says Tough Neighborhood|work=The Wall Street Journal Online|accessdate = 2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |agency=Associated Press |date=2004-01-05 |url=http://www.news4jax.com/news/2742092/detail.html |title=Police: Teens Rape, Rob Tallahassee Pizza Delivery Woman |publisher=News4Jax.com |accessdate=2007-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022051756/http://www.news4jax.com/news/2742092/detail.html |archivedate=2007-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fake orders are sometimes used to lure robbery victims or kidnappings, and delivery people have been injured and killed in robberies and kidnappings.&lt;ref name=&quot;wlwt1&quot;&gt;[http://www.wlwt.com/news/21241546/detail.html Pizza Chains Create 'Do Not Deliver' List - Some Areas Deemed Too Unsafe For Pizza Deliveries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929161814/http://www.wlwt.com/news/21241546/detail.html |date=2011-09-29 }}, WLWT, Cincinnati News, October 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2007/07/23/swick.html Two teens charged with murder of pizza delivery driver], ''The Columbus Dispatch'', July 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pizza delivery workers who have been lured and murdered include [[Murder of Yafim Weinstein|Yafim Weinstein]], [[Death of Brian Douglas Wells|Brian Douglas Wells]], and [[Bailey Junior Kurariki|Michael Choy]].

==In popular culture==
[[File:World-wide delivery in 30 minutes or less.JPG|thumb|right|[[Minuteman Missile National Historic Site]] entrance door]]

Pizza delivery has been featured as a major element in several media in popular culture. There are several works of fiction where the main character delivers pizzas, including [[Tom Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[I Am Charlotte Simmons]]'' (2004), and [[Neal Stephenson]]'s [[cyberpunk]] novel ''[[Snow Crash]]'' (1992), which posits a future in which pizza delivery is organised by the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] as one of the US's four major industries. Several feature films also use pizza delivery prominently, including the 1984 comedy ''[[Delivery Boys]]'', the [[Spike Lee]] [[1989 in film|1989]] film ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', and the 2000 [[comedy]] film ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]''. In the case of other films, use of pizza delivery has been regarded by critics as &quot;overly integrated [[product placement]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;boerner&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author = Heather Boerner|url = http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/R-L-Stines-Haunting.html|title = Review of ''R.L. Stine's Haunting House: Don't Think About'': Tween-friendly, ad-happy Halloween fright fest|publisher = Common Sense Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizza delivery has been the subject of films, even to the point of being the subject of such feature-length films as ''[[Drivers Wanted]]'' and ''[[Fat Pizza: The Movie]]'', as well as ''Pizza: The Movie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Joshua Tyler|url = http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Pizza-The-Movie-583.html|title = ''Pizza: The Movie'' - Review|date = 2004-07-25 |work=Cinema Blend}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pizza delivery has served as major plot element of such films as ''[[Loverboy (1989 film)|Loverboy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Caryn James|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D8123AF93AA15757C0A96F948260|title = Reviews/Film; A Youth's Salty Specialty On a Pizza-Delivery Route|work=The New York Times|date = April 29, 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 American comedy film ''[[30 Minutes or Less]]'' is concerned about the kidnapping of a pizza-delivery driver and his subsequent coercive involvement in a [[bank robbery]], which was loosely based on the 2003 death of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] pizza deliveryman [[Death of Brian Douglas Wells|Brian Douglas Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;The Tennessean August 11, 2011 Section D&lt;/ref&gt; In television, the Australian comedy series ''[[Pizza (TV series)|Pizza]]'' centres on Pauly and his co-workers who deliver pizzas for a Sydney-based pizzeria called Fat Pizza.

{{unreferenced|date=March 2017}}
A '''pizza farm''' is an educational visitor attraction consisting of a small [[farm]] on a circular piece of land partitioned into plots shaped like [[pizza]] wedges. 
The farm's segments produce ingredients that can be used in pizza, such as [[wheat]] for the crust, [[tomato]]es or [[herb]]s, [[pork]] for [[pepperoni]], [[Dairy cattle|dairy cows]] for [[cheese]], and even trees for pizza oven [[firewood]].  Certain farms may even have access to coal or natural gas deposits that can be used as additional pizza oven heating fuels.  Many of the newer pizza farms are experimenting with [[alternative energy]], such as installing [[wind turbines]] in the fields, to be more green. According to a 2005 article in USA Today, there are several such farms in the United States.

The dough is usually a bread dough thicker than that of the classic [[pizza Margherita]], and the traditional topping consists of usually caramelised (almost pureed) [[onion]]s, [[black olive]]s, and [[Anchovy|anchovies]] (whole, and sometimes also with ''[[pissalat]]'', a type of anchovy paste).&lt;ref name=child&gt;Julia Child (1961) ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking'' Vol. 1, Alfred A.

The etymology of the word seems to be from the Latin ''piscis'',&lt;ref name=EDMF&gt;{{cite book | last =David | first = Elizabeth| authorlink = | coauthors = | title =A Book of Mediterranean Food | publisher = Grub Street| year = 1999| location = London| pages =38/39 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-902304-27-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn became ''pissalat'' (via ''peis salat'', &quot;salted fish&quot; in [[Ligurian (ancient language)|Ligurian]] and [[Niçard]]).&lt;ref&gt;Benvenuto, Alex.

'''Pizza cheese''' encompasses several varieties and types of [[cheese]]s and [[dairy product]]s that are designed and manufactured for use specifically on [[pizza]]. These include [[processed cheese|processed]] and modified cheese such as [[mozzarella]]-like processed cheeses and mozzarella variants. The term can also refer to any type of cheese suitable for use on pizza.&lt;ref name=johncorrell/&gt; The most popular cheeses used in the preparation of pizza are mozzarella (accounting for about 30%), [[provolone]], [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]] and [[Parmesan]]. [[Emmental cheese|Emmental]], [[Pecorino Romano|Romano]] and [[ricotta]] are often used as toppings, and processed pizza cheeses manufactured specifically for pizza are [[mass production|mass-produced]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IrishTimes 2014&quot;/&gt; Some mass-produced pizza cheeses are frozen after manufacturing and shipped frozen.

Processed pizza cheese is manufactured to produce optimal qualities in [[Browning (food process)|browning]], [[melting]], stretchiness and [[fat]] and moisture content. Several studies and experiments have analyzed the impact of [[vegetable oil]], manufacturing and culture processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.danisco.com/about-dupont/news/news-archive/2012/dupont-hurdles-the-process-challenges-for-pizza-cheese/ | title=DuPont Nutrition &amp; Health Hurdles the Process Challenges for Pizza Cheese | publisher=DuPont Nutrition &amp; Health |work=Danisco.com | date=April 3, 2012 | accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; denatured [[whey protein]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AJDT-2001&quot;/&gt; and other changes to create ideal and economical pizza cheeses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guinee 2000&quot;/&gt; In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese products was 2 billion pounds in the United States and 200 million pounds in Europe, and in 2000 demand for the product in Europe was increasing by 8% per year. The trend of steadily-increasing production and consumption of mozzarella and pizza cheese continued into the first decade of the 21st century in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kindstedt 2012&quot;/&gt;

Pizza cheese frequently consists of a blend of two or more cheeses, such as low-moisture Mozzarella or Provolone.&lt;ref name=johncorrell /&gt; Low-moisture Mozzarella was first manufactured in dairy factories in the Midwestern United States, and was originally called &quot;pizza cheese&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CST 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Pizza cheese?

Globally, Mozzarella is the most popular pizza cheese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard 2014&quot;/&gt; However, it has been estimated that in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes2007&quot;/&gt; [[Provolone]] is the second most popular one.&lt;ref name=johncorrell /&gt; [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness.&lt;ref name=johncorrell /&gt; Grated [[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmesan]] may be added to the top of a pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked.&lt;ref name=johncorrell /&gt; A diverse variety of [[processed cheese|processed]] pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. [[Provel]] is one example. Other pizza cheeses include [[Emmental cheese|Emmental]], [[Pecorino Romano|Romano]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bittman 2010&quot;/&gt; and [[Ricotta]] for [[calzone]]s or as a topping.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraioli 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler Fertig 2014&quot;/&gt;

Several cheeses may be mixed together in its formulation, and each has individual browning and blistering characteristics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard 2014&quot;/&gt; For example, a combination of Mozzarella and Cheddar may blister less when cooked compared to other combinations, because cheddar has less elasticity, while Mozzarella and provolone may brown less compared to other combinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard 2014&quot;/&gt;

==Overview==
Due to the [[thermal mass]] of baking stones and the material's property as a poor heat conductor, food is less likely to burn when using a baking stone than when using metal or glass bakeware. Baking stones are a variation on hot stone cooking which is one of the oldest cooking techniques known. Some cooks recommend sprinkling [[corn meal]] or flour on the baking stone to prevent the crust from sticking, or using [[parchment paper]] atop the stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan 2011 p. 263&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Jordan | first=M. | title=California Home Cooking: 400 Recipes that Celebrate the Abundance of Farm and Garden, Orchard and Vineyard, Land and Sea | publisher=Harvard Common Press | series=America cooks | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-55832-119-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NDuMDMLKtHMC&amp;pg=PA263 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks 2006 p. 13&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Brooks | first=M. | title=The Guaranteed No Burnt Bottoms Cookies Cookbook | publisher=Monica's Best Bakes | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-615-13418-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGkzCNdhLGoC&amp;pg=PA13 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reinhart Manville 2011 p. 260&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Reinhart | first=P. | last2=Manville | first2=R. | title=The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread | publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony | series=The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-60774-129-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htveL1MPqYMC&amp;pg=PA260 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Black 2016 p. 158&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Black | first=S. | title=One Dough, Ten Breads: Making Great Bread by Hand | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year=2016 | isbn=978-0-544-57933-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2cGCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baking &quot;stones&quot; may be purchased as unglazed ceramic tiles, unglazed fired clay tiles and quarried tiles, from tile shops and hardware stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler Stratton 2005 p. 27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reinhart Manville 2007 p. 85&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Reinhart | first=P. | last2=Manville | first2=R. | title=Peter Reinhart's Whole Grain Breads: New Techniques, Extraordinary Flavor | publisher=Ten Speed Press | series=Cookery, Food and Drink Series | year=2007 | isbn=978-1-58008-759-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJrYTmaI0UsC&amp;pg=PA85 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alterman Nauman 2015 p. 90&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Alterman | first=T. | last2=Nauman | first2=T. | title=Whole Grain Baking Made Easy: Craft Delicious, Healthful Breads, Pastries, Desserts, and More - Including a Comprehensive Guide to Grinding Grains | publisher=Voyageur Press | year=2015 | isbn=978-0-7603-4598-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2o-1CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pizza stone==
When designed for cooking [[pizza]]s, a baking stone is often referred to as a pizza stone. Using a pizza stone more or less mimicks the effects of cooking a pizza in a [[masonry oven]]. The [[porous]] nature of the stone used also helps absorb moisture, resulting in a crispy crust. Small pizza stones can be purchased to fit in any conventional cooking [[oven]] or an enclosed [[barbecue grill|barbecue-style grill]]. High-end ovens sometimes offer optional pizza stones that are specifically designed for each oven model and may include a specialized [[heating element]].  In addition to traditional methods, a Pizza stone can also be made out of metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Parsons, Russ | title=A pizza stone of steel | website=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 1, 2013 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/01/news/la-dd-a-pizza-stone-of-steel-20130131 | access-date=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Perry, Charles | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/22/food/fo-soapstone22 |title=Soapstone: cookware that rocks |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=February 22, 2006 |accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Pizza Underground''' was an American [[Comedy music|comedy]] [[Rock music|rock]] band based in [[New York City]]. Mainly [[Parody music|parodying]] songs by [[the Velvet Underground]] with [[pizza]]-themed song names and lyrics, the group consisted of former [[child actor]] [[Macaulay Culkin]] ([[kazoo]], [[percussion]] and vocals) along with Matt Colbourn (guitar, vocals), [[Phoebe Kreutz]] ([[glockenspiel]], vocals), Deenah Vollmer ([[pizza box]], vocals) and Austin Kilham ([[tambourine]], vocals).&lt;ref name=pitchfork&gt;{{cite web|last=Pelly|first=Jenn|title=Listen: Macaulay Culkin Has a Pizza-Themed Velvet Underground Cover Band, The Pizza Underground|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/53269-listen-macaulay-culkin-has-a-pizza-themed-velvet-underground-cover-band-the-pizza-underground/|work=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jezebel&gt;{{cite web|last=Beck|first=Laura|title=Macaulay Culkin Has a Pizza-Themed Velvet Underground Cover Band|url=http://jezebel.com/macaulay-culkin-has-a-pizza-themed-velvet-underground-c-1479308740|work=[[Jezebel]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rollingstone&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayers|first=Mike|title=Inside Macaulay Culkin's Pizza Underground Sessions|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/inside-macaulay-culkins-pizza-underground-sessions-20131212|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the theme, the band gave out boxed pizzas to people who attended their live performances.

==History==

Deenah Vollmer, the group's &quot;pizza box&quot; percussionist, said the idea for the Pizza Underground began as a joke in 2012.&lt;ref name=philly&gt;{{cite web|last=Amorosi|first=A.D.|title=Season of tributes to Lou Reed - including Macaulay Culkin's band Pizza Underground Read|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/music/20140123_Macaulay_Culkin_s_Pizza_Underground_brings_Velvet_tribute_to_PhilaMOCA.html|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=philly.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We soon realized you can replace most any word with slice or cheese,&quot; she told ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. [[Glockenspiel]] player Phoebe Kreutz stated they believed the Velvet Underground songs were written about pizza, but had to be reworded to accommodate the &quot;standards of their day.&quot;&lt;ref name=philly /&gt;

On November 11, 2013, the group recorded a live demo at [[Macaulay Culkin]]'s house.&lt;ref name=pitchfork /&gt; That same month they performed a [[Lou Reed]] tribute show at the Sidewalk Cafe in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|last=Michaels|first=Sean|title=Macaulay Culkin forms pizza-themed Velvet Underground tribute band|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/09/macaulay-culkin-pizza-velvet-underground|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, a viral video of Culkin eating a cheese pizza was uploaded to [[YouTube]]. He was parodying [[Andy Warhol]] consuming a [[Burger King Whopper]] in [[Jørgen Leth]]'s documentary ''66 Scenes from America''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pzm1lQX0qU&lt;/ref&gt; Culkin was promoting the debut of the Pizza Underground.&lt;ref&gt;Luling, Todd Van, December 27, 2013 [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/27/pizza-news-2013_n_4462102.html 'The 34 greatest moments in pizza history from 2013'], retrieved December 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The group released its first music video in January 2014, parodying various Velvet Underground songs such as &quot;All Pizza Parties&quot; (&quot;[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]&quot;), &quot;Pizza Gal&quot; (&quot;[[Femme Fatale (The Velvet Underground song)|Femme Fatale]]&quot;) and &quot;Take a Bite of the Wild Slice&quot; ([[Lou Reed]]'s &quot;[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=huffpost&gt;{{cite web|last=Kristobak|first=Ryan|title=Macaulay Culkin Band Pizza Underground's First Music Video Is Full Of Pizza Faces|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/07/macaulay-culkin-pizza-band-video_n_4556771.html|work=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video featured the group performing on a bed of pizza boxes, surrounded by pizza checkered walls, with members of the group wearing slices of pizza as masks.&lt;ref name=daily_news&gt;{{cite web|last=Eby|first=Margaret|title=Macaulay Culkin's Pizza Underground band debuts saucy music video|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/macauley-culkin-pizza-underground-band-debuts-video-article-1.1569761|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2014, the cassette of the demo was released by Bitter Melody Records&lt;ref&gt;Bitter Melody Records, [http://bittermelodyrecords.limitedrun.com/about About Bitter Melody Records].

'''National pizza month''' is an American observance that occurs for the month of October every year.

==History==
This observance began in October 1984, and was created by Gerry Durnell, the publisher of ''[[Pizza Today]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPM&quot;/&gt; Some people observe National pizza month by consuming various types of [[pizza]]s or pizza slices, or going to various pizzerias.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genovese&quot;/&gt; During the month, some [[pizzerias]] give away free pizzas or pizza slices to customers or offer reduced-price promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmq.com/October-2014/Pie-Five-Pies-It-Forward-For-National-Pizza-Month/|title=Pie Five Pizza pays it forward|publisher=PMQ Pizza Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/26685710/pizza-restaurant-gives-away-free-pies-in-honor-of-national-pizza-month|title=Pizza restaurant gives away free pies in honor of National Pizza|date=2 October 2014|publisher=DC News FOX 5|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/story/23598725/happys-pizza-celebrating-national-pizza-month|title=Happy's Pizza celebrating National Pizza Month|date=3 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmq.com/September-2014/Dominos-Pizza-to-Offer-Weeklong-Carryout-Special-Just-in-Time-for-National-Pizza-Month/|title=Domino's has deal for national pizza month|publisher=PMQ Pizza Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some businesses run fundraising drives, donating proceeds of pizza sales to benefit various organizations or charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmq.com/October-2012/Pizza-Pizza-Closes-National-Pizza-Month-With-Fundraiser-for-Childrens-Miracle-Network/|title=Pizza Pizza Closes National Pizza Month With Fundraiser for Children's Miracle Network|publisher=PMQ Pizza Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODgtAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22National+pizza+month%22+fundraiser&amp;dq=%22National+pizza+month%22+fundraiser&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3C0_VOKZCMHCigLr3IGQBA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA|title=Pizza Today|publisher=Pizza Today|accessdate=16 October 2014|pages=8, 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restaurantnews.com/old-chicago-pizza-taproom-donating-1-from-select-specialty-pizzas-to-benefit-childrens-hospital-medical-center-this-month/|date=October 14, 2014|title=Old Chicago Pizza &amp; Taproom Donating $1 From Select Specialty Pizzas To Benefit Children’s Hospital &amp; Medical Center This Month|work=|accessdate=16 October 2014|publisher=Restaurant News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pizzerias create unique pizzas that they don't routinely offer.

'''Raffaele Esposito''' was the [[Italy|Italian]] owner of a [[tavern]] called [[Pizzeria di Pietro e Basta Cosi]] in the Nineteenth century, and is considered by some to be the father of modern [[pizza]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;&gt;Arthur Schwartz, ''Naples at Table: Cooking in Campania'' (1998), p. 68. {{ISBN|9780060182618}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickie&quot;&gt;John Dickie, ''Delizia!: The Epic History of the Italians and Their Food'' (2008), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1889, pizza had not yet become a popular or well-known dish, and was typically eaten by poor people as a way to use up various ingredients that would otherwise go to waste.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofmann&quot;&gt;Paul Hofmann, ''That Fine Italian Hand'' (1991), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Esposito was considered the premier pizza-maker in the city of [[Naples]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orsini&quot;&gt;Father Giuseppe Orsini, Joseph E. Orsini, ''Italian Baking Secrets'' (2007), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Esposito was therefore requested to prepare a pizza for Queen [[Margherita of Savoy]], who had traveled to Naples with [[King Umberto I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;/&gt; Esposito and his wife were admitted to the royal kitchens to prepare this dish as he saw fit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orsini&quot;/&gt; Deeming the traditional [[garlic]] topping to be unfit for the royal palate, Esposito instead prepared three different pizzas,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickie&quot;/&gt; the last of which used a combination of [[tomato]]es, [[mozzarella]] cheese and [[basil]] to emulate the red, white, and green of the [[Flag of Italy|Italian flag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;/&gt; It is claimed by some sources that this was the first time pizza was made with mozzarella cheese.&lt;ref&gt;James McNair, ''Pizza'' (1987), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Margherita, having never had pizza before, so enjoyed the dish that she had her head of table services send Esposito a letter to commend his pizzas, stating that they &quot;were found to be delicious&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;/&gt; Esposito used this recommendation to successfully [[Marketing|promote]] his restaurant,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;/&gt; naming the pizza most enjoyed by the Queen, &quot;[[Pizza Margherita]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Stradley, &quot;[http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Pizza/PizzaHistory.htm History and Legends of Pizza]&quot; (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is widely reported that this event caused pizza to become a fad,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orsini&quot;/&gt; from which it retained enduring popularity. Because of Esposito's experiments with ingredients and presentation, and his successful preparation of the dish for Queen Margherita, it is suggested by some that Esposito was the father of the modern pizza.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orsini&quot;/&gt; Esposito's restaurant still exists, although the name has been changed to Pizzeria di Brandi, and the royal letter favoring Esposito's pizza is on display in the restaurant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;/&gt;

'''Garlic knots''' are a type of [[garlic bread]] found primarily in [[pizzeria]]s around New York City and the surrounding regions. They were developed in 1973 in Ozone Park, Queens, as a way of making use of pizza dough scraps, and very quickly caught on.

The dough is rolled and then pulled into small, tight overhand knots, and pre-baked in a pizza oven (authentically, at temperatures of 700°F or higher). The knots are then dipped in or generously brushed with a mix of oil, parmesan cheese, and crushed garlic; variations can include finely chopped parsley, dried oregano, or black pepper. Before serving, garlic knots are baked a second time, and may be accompanied with marinara sauce.

As they're traditionally a way to make use of scraps, garlic knots tend to be the least expensive item on a pizzeria menu, often provided as complimentary with larger orders.

The '''history of [[pizza]]''' begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced flatbreads with toppings. 

The precursor of pizza was probably the [[focaccia]], a flat bread known to the Romans as ''panis focacius'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiantourism.com/pane.html &quot;panis focacius denoted a flat bread cooked in the ashes (&quot;focus&quot; meant hearth)&quot; - ENIT North America]&lt;/ref&gt; to which toppings were then added.&lt;ref name=Treasures&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Burtan|title=Treasures of the Italian Table|year=1994|publisher=William Morrow and Company|isbn=978-0688115579|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern pizza developed in [[Naples]], when tomato was added to the focaccia in the late 18th century.

The word ''pizza'' was first documented in AD 997&amp;nbsp;in [[Gaeta]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Salvatore Riciniello (1987) ''Codice Diplomatico Gaetano'', Vol. I, La Poligrafica&lt;/ref&gt; and successively in different parts of [[Central Italy|Central]] and [[Southern Italy]]. Pizza was mainly eaten in the country of Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II, when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.


==Innovation==
The innovation that led to flat bread pizza was the use of [[tomato]] as a topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to [[Europe]] from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous (as some other fruits of the [[nightshade]] family are). However, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around [[Naples]] to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and so the pizza began.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of the city to try the local specialty.

Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries, and pizzerias keep this old tradition alive today. It is possible to enjoy paper-wrapped pizza and a drink sold from open-air stands outside the premises. [[Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba]] in Naples is widely regarded as the city's first pizzeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/showassoc_eng.php?id=140 |title=Avpn |publisher=Pizzanapoletana.org |date=1984-09-28 |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purists, like the famous pizzeria &quot;Da Michele&quot; in Via C. Sersale (founded 1870),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damichele.net/ |title=Antica Pizzeria &quot;Da Michele&quot; dal 1870 |publisher=Damichele.net |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider there to be only two true pizzas—the [[Marinara sauce|marinara]] and the margherita—and that is all they serve. These two &quot;pure&quot; pizzas are the ones preferred by many Italians today.

The marinara is the older of the two and has a topping of tomato, [[oregano]], [[garlic]], and [[extra virgin olive oil]]. It is named “marinara” because it was traditionally the food prepared by &quot;la marinara&quot;, the seaman's wife, for her seafaring husband when he returned from fishing trips in the [[Gulf of Naples|Bay of Naples]].

The margherita is topped with modest amounts of tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and fresh basil. It is widely attributed to baker [[Raffaele Esposito]], who worked at &quot;Pizzeria di Pietro&quot;, established in 1880. Though recent research casts doubt on this legend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tale holds that, in 1889, he baked three different pizzas for the visit of King [[Umberto I of Italy|Umberto I]] and Queen [[Margherita of Savoy]]. The Queen's favorite was a pizza evoking the colors of the Italian flag—green ([[basil]] leaves), white ([[mozzarella]]), and red ([[tomato]]es).&lt;ref name=amherit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=American Pie |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_30.shtml |quote=Cheese, the crowning ingredient, was not added until 1889, when the Royal Palace commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three contenders he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pie swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). |work=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |date=April–May 2006 |accessdate=2009-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712030514/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_30.shtml |archivedate=2009-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tale, this combination was named Pizza Margherita in her honor. Although those were the most preferred, today there are many variations of pizzas.

&quot;Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pizzanapoletana1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/index_eng.php |title=Avpn - Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana |publisher=Pizzanapoletana.org |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;True Neapolitan Pizza Association&quot;), which was founded in 1984, has set the very specific rules that must be followed for an authentic Neapolitan pizza. These include that the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed oven; that the base must be hand-kneaded and must not be rolled with a pin or prepared by any mechanical means (''i pizzaioli''—the pizza makers—make the pizza by rolling it with their fingers) and that the pizza must not exceed 35 centimetres in diameter or be more than one-third of a centimetre thick at the centre. The association also selects pizzerias all around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana philosophy and method.

There are many famous pizzerias in Naples where these traditional pizzas can be found such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo, Trianon, and Umberto (founded: 1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umberto.it/ |title=Benvenuti su umberto.it |publisher=Umberto.it |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them are in the ancient historical centre of Naples. These pizzerias will go even further than the specified rules by, for example, using only [[San Marzano tomato]]es grown on the slopes of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in only a clockwise direction.

The pizza bases in Naples are soft and pliable. In Rome they prefer a thin and crispy base. Another popular form of pizza in Italy is &quot;[[pizza al taglio]]&quot;, which is pizza baked in rectangular trays with a wide variety of toppings and sold by weight.

In 1962, the &quot;Hawaiian&quot; pizza, a pizza topped with pineapple and ham, was invented in Canada by restaurateur Sam Panopoulis at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Nosowitz |title=Meet the 81-Year-Old Greek-Canadian Inventor of the Hawaiian Pizza|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-inventor-of-hawaiian-pizza |work=[[Atlas Obscura]] |location=Unknown |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, the pizza napoletana was granted [[Protected Geographical Status|Traditional Speciality Guaranteed]] status by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Hooper |title=Pizza napoletana awarded special status by EU |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/09/italian-pizza-wins-protected-status |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the world's largest pizza was made in Rome, and was measured to be 1261.65 square metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-pizza|title=Largest pizza|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, robotics company [[BeeHex]], widely covered in the media, was building robots that 3D-printed pizza.&lt;ref name = digitaltrends&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/beehex-3d-printed-pizza/ | title = NASA wants astronauts to have 3D printed pizza, and this startup is building a printer to make it happen | publisher = [[Digital Trends]] | accessdate = 16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the pizza napoletana was inscribed on the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Naples' pizza twirling wins Unesco ‘intangible’ status |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/naples-pizza-twirling-wins-unesco-intangible-status |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=7 December 2017 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pizza in Canada==
[[Canada]] was first introduced to pizza in the late 1950s, with the first pizza ovens entering the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=02f306cd-5f68-4472-82d8-af9524003ec1 |title=Bringing the first pizza ovens to Canada in the 1950s|publisher=Canada.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country. Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small [[pizzerias]]. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and [[poutine]], salad, and [[calzones]]. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.

The most distinct pizza in Canada is the &quot;Canadian&quot; pizza. A “Canadian” pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with &quot;Canadian bacon&quot;, or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.

In Canada, pizza is served on a variety of crust types, including a traditional-style pan crust, a thin crust, multi-grain crust, whole-grain crust, and a gluten-free crust. Stuffed-crust pizza is also a popular pizza alternative for Canadian customers. It contains pizza toppings of the customer’s choice on a mozzarella-filled crust.

In the province of Quebec [[Pizza-ghetti]] is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese

Some of Canada’s successful pizza brands include: [[Boston Pizza]], [[Pizza Pizza]], and Vanelli’s. Boston Pizza, also known as BP’s in Canada, and &quot;Boston's—the Gourmet Pizza&quot; in the United States and Mexico, is one of Canada’s largest franchising restaurants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boston Pizza Company History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bostonpizza.com/assets/mediacentre/documents/pdf/Boston_Pizza_-_Company_History.pdf |title=Boston Pizza Company History |publisher=bostonpizza.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand has opened over 325 locations across Canada and 50 locations in Mexico and the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boston Pizza Company History&quot;/&gt; The first Boston Pizza location was opened in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1964, and operated under the name &quot;Boston Pizza &amp; Spaghetti House&quot;, with locations still opening across the nation. It is the first Canadian restaurant to introduce the heart-shaped pizza on Valentine’s Day, a 22-year tradition, where a dollar from each pizza ordered supports Boston Pizza Foundation Future Prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.leaderpost.com/2014/02/05/boston-pizza-once-again-offering-heart-shaped-pizzas-for-valentines-day/

Vanelli’s is an international pizza chain that is based in [[Mississauga, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lAbout Us Us&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanellisrestaurants.com/en/about-us |title=lAbout Us Us|publisher=vanellisrestaurant.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chain first opened in 1981, serving both pizza and other fresh Italian cuisine, such as pasta and Italian sandwiches.&lt;ref name=&quot;lAbout Us Us&quot;/&gt;  In 1995, the brand opened its first international location in [[Bahrain]] and became an international success. The brand continued to open additional locations across the Middle East, with chains now opened in the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanellisrestaurants.com/en/locations |title=locations|publisher=vanellisrestaurant.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 110 locations worldwide; making Vanelli’s the first pizza brand in Canada to open locations internationally.

With pizza gaining popularity across the nation, major American pizza chains such as [[Pizza Hut]], [[Domino’s Pizza]] and [[Little Caesars]] have expanded their locations in Canada, competing against the domestic Canadian brands. The major American pizza chains have brought their signature classic pizza recipes and toppings into their Canadian chains, offering their traditional classic pizzas to Canadian customers. However, the American chains have also created Canadian specialty pizzas that are available only in Canada. Pizzas that have been made exclusively for Canada by the American chain Pizza Hut for a limited time, included the following:

* Hot Dog [[Stuffed crust pizza|Stuffed Crust Pizza]]: an angus beef hot dog, placed inside a stuffed crust, served in a medium or large pizza, with toppings of the customer’s choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pizza Hut Pizzas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/06/11/new-pizza-hut-pizzas_n_3423659.html |title=New Pizza Hut Pizzas |publisher=huffingtonpost.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Grilled Chicken Club: a spin on Canada’s popular sandwich that is served with an alfredo sauce, grilled chicken strips, bacon, diced tomatoes, lettuce, mozzarella cheese and a pepper mayo sauce.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pizza Hut Pizzas&quot;/&gt;
* Smokey Maple Bacon Pizza: a pizza served with Alfredo sauce, maple bacon strips, bacon crumble, sliced mushrooms, shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pizza Hut Pizzas&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Pizza in the United States}}
[[File:My Tomato Pie Pizza and Calzone.jpg|thumb|A pizza pie. In the background is a [[calzone]]]]
[[File:Pizza with roast chicken.jpg|thumb|Pizza with roast chicken]]
Pizza first made its appearance in the [[United States]] with the arrival of Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and was very popular among large Italian populations in [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[St. Louis|Saint Louis]]. In the late 19th century, pizza was introduced by peddlers who walked up and down the streets with a metal washtub of pizzas on their heads, selling their pizzas at two cents a slice. It was not long until small cafes and groceries began offering pizzas to their [[Italian American]] communities.

The first printed reference to &quot;pizza&quot; served in the US is a 1904 article in ''[[The Boston Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adam |last=Kuban |url=http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2009/01/dear-slice-boston-may-have-had-the-first-pizza-in-the-us.html |title=Dear Slice: Boston May Have Had the First Pizza in America |department=Dear Slice (blog) |publisher=Serious Eats |date=January 5, 2009 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanni and Gennaro Bruno came to America from Naples, Italy in 1903 to introduce the Neapolitan Pizza.{{clarify|date=July 2014|reason=Did they immigrate, or was it a business trip?}} Vincent (Jimmy) Bruno (Giovanni's son) went on to open the first pizzeria in [[Chicago Loop|The Loop]] in Chicago at 421 S. Wabash Avenue, the Yacht Club. Gennaro Lombardi opened a grocery store in 1897 which was later established as the &quot;said&quot; first pizzeria in America in 1905 with New York's issuance of the mercantile license. An employee of his, Antonio Totonno Pero, began making pizza for the store to sell that same year. The price for a pizza was five cents, but since many people could not afford the cost of a whole pie, they would instead say how much they could pay and they were given a slice corresponding to the amount offered. In 1924, Totonno left [[Lombardi's]] to open his own pizzeria on [[Coney Island]] called [[Totonno's]]. While the original Lombardi's closed its doors in 1984, it was reopened in 1994 just down the street and is run by Lombardi's grandson.

Pizza was brought to the [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] area of [[New Jersey]] with Joe's Tomato Pies opening in 1910, followed soon by [[Papa's Tomato Pies]] in 1912. In 1936, [[De Lorenzo's Tomato Pies]] was opened. While Joe's Tomato Pies has closed, both Papa's and Delorenzo's have been run by the same families since their openings and remain among the most popular pizzas in the area. [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana]] in [[New Haven]], Connecticut, was another early pizzeria which opened in 1925 (after the owner served pies from local carts and bakeries for 20–25 years) and is famous for its New Haven–style Clam Pie. Frank Pepe's nephew Sal Consiglio opened a competing store, [[Sally's Apizza]], on the other end of the block, in 1938. Both establishments are still run by descendants of the original family. When Sal died, over 2,000 people attended his wake, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a half-page memoriam. The D'Amore family introduced pizza to [[Los Angeles]] in 1939.

Before the 1940s, pizza consumption was limited mostly to Italian immigrants and their descendants. The international breakthrough came after World War II. Allied troops occupying Italy, weary of their rations, were constantly on the lookout for good food. They discovered the pizzeria and local bakers were hard-pressed to satisfy the demand from the soldiers. The American troops involved in the Italian campaign took their appreciation for the dish back home, touted by &quot;veterans ranging from the lowliest private to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]&quot;.{{cite quote|date=January 2017}} By the 1960s, it was popular enough to be featured in an episode of [[Popeye the Sailor (1960s TV series)|Popeye the Sailor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon-story/52506-Popeyes-Pizza-Palace Popeye's Pizza Palace], The Big Cartoon Database&lt;/ref&gt;

Two entrepreneurs, Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo, invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, in 1943. They opened their own restaurant on the corner of Wabash and Ohio, [[Uno Chicago Grill|Pizzeria Uno]].

Chain restaurants sprang up with pizza's popularity rising. Leading early pizza chains were [[Shakey's Pizza]], founded in 1954 in [[Sacramento]], California; [[Pizza Hut]], founded in 1958 in [[Wichita, Kansas]]; and Josey's Pizza founded in [[Newnan]], Georgia, in 1943. Later entrant restaurant chains to the dine-in pizza market were [[Bertucci's]], [[Happy Joe's]], [[Monical's Pizza]], [[California Pizza Kitchen]], [[Godfather's Pizza]], and [[Round Table Pizza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlhU8-nAw2k |title=CBC Archives: New 50's Food - Pizza! 1957 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''pizza box''' or '''pizza package''' is a folding [[box]] made of [[cardboard]] in which hot [[pizzas]] are stored in for [[takeaway]]. The &quot;pizza box&quot; also makes [[home delivery]] and [[takeaway]] substantially easier. The pizza box has to be highly resistant, cheap, stackable, thermally insulated to regulate humidity and suitable for food transportation. In addition, it provides space for advertising. The pizza packages differ from those of frozen pizzas, which contain the frozen product in heat-sealed plastic foils as is the case with much [[frozen food]].

== History ==
[[File:Pizza box collection point Old Orchard Beach ME.jpg|thumb|upright|A pizza box collection point at Old Orchard Beach, Maine]]
Containers to deliver freshly baked pizzas have existed at least since the 19th century, when [[Neapolitan pizza|Neapolitan]] pizza bakers put their products in multi-layered metallic containers known as ''stufe'' (singular ''stufa'', &quot;oven&quot;) and then sent them to the street sellers. The aerated container was round and made of tin or copper.&lt;ref name=&quot;blu63&quot;&gt;[[Heston Blumenthal]]: ''In Search of Perfection.'' Bloomsbury Publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7475-8409-5}}, S.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt;
Disposable packaging started to be developed in the [[United States]], after the [[Second World War]]. At that time pizza was becoming increasingly popular and the first pizza delivery services were created. In the beginning they attempted to deliver pizzas in simple cardboard boxes, similar to those used in cake shops, but these often became wet, bent or even broke in two. Other pizza chefs tried to put pizzas on plates and transport them inside paper bags. This partly solved the problem. However, it was almost impossible to transport at the same time more pizzas inside one bag. In this way, the pizzas on the top would have ruined the surface of the others.&lt;ref name=&quot;mad&quot; /&gt;

The first patent for a pizza box made of [[corrugated cardboard]] was applied in 1963 and it already displayed the characteristics of today's pizza packaging: plane blanks, foldability without need of adhesive, stackability and ventilation slots.&lt;ref name=&quot;USP3163344&quot;&gt;Abraham L. Tunick, Container, [http://www.ptodirect.com/Results/Patents?query=PN/3163344 U.S. Patent 3,163,344] erteilt am 29. Dezember 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of such slots along with water vapour absorbing materials ([[Absorption of water|absorption agent]]) prevented the humidity build-ups that characterized traditional transport packaging.&lt;ref name=&quot;USP3163344&quot; /&gt;
It is assumed that the pizza box was invented by [[Domino's Pizza]], even if they did not file a [[patent]] application.&lt;ref name=&quot;mad&quot; /&gt; Until 1988 this chain employed a type of packaging whose front side was not directly connected to the lateral sides,&lt;ref name=&quot;CorrellHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Pizza Packaging, Overview &amp; History|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.correllconcepts.com/Pizza_Packaging/history.htm|deadurl=|accessdate=2012-03-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825231309/http://www.correllconcepts.com/Pizza_Packaging/history.htm|archivedate=2012-08-25|last=John Correll|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather the flaps fixed to the lateral sides were folded inward under the lid. This design is also known as &quot;Chicago folding&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CorrellHistory&quot; /&gt; Domino's was the first pizza producer which employed pizza boxes on a large scale and in this way expanded its delivery range beyond the area immediately close to the pizzeria.&lt;ref name=&quot;hai241&quot;&gt;Matt Haig: ''Brand Success: How the World's Top 100 Brands Thrive and Survive.'' Kogan Page Publishers, 2011, {{ISBN|0-7494-6287-6}}, S. 241. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=DVL8R8yz0xEC&amp;pg=PA241 Google Vorschau])&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 1960s, the delivery service was further developed thanks to the introduction of heat-insulating bags.&lt;ref name=&quot;USP3428103&quot;&gt;Jean L. Walsh, Insulated Container for Pizza Pies, [http://www.ptodirect.com/Results/Patents?query=PN/3428103 U.S. Patent 3,428,103] erteilt am 18. Februar 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pizzakarton Traditional.svg|thumb|'Traditional' way of folding a pizza box]]
Most packaging for the transport of pizzas is made of [[cardboard]], because this material is cheap and has many useful properties. Both solid fibre board and single wall corrugated board are used. The corrugated cardboard in use is often of the E flute size (micro or fine waves with a flute pitch of 1.0 to 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm), but thicker B flute cardboard with a flute pitch of 2.2 to 3.0&amp;nbsp;mm are also used.&lt;ref name=&quot;CorrellStructuralOptions&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Pizza Packaging, Structural Options, Pros &amp; Cons|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.correllconcepts.com/Pizza_Packaging/structural%20_options.htm|deadurl=|accessdate=2012-03-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819160624/http://www.correllconcepts.com/Pizza_Packaging/structural%20_options.htm|archivedate=2012-08-19|last=John Correll|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only the geometric construction of the cardboard determines the stability of the box, but also especially the type of paper and its grammage. For the liner mostly [[containerboard]] is used on the inside of the box. This does not only make the box stable, it becomes more resistant against humidity and oil as well.
To reduce the space needed to store the packaging to a minimum, the pizza boxes are folded just before use out of flat blanks. The required storage space depends very much on the different thickness of the material.&lt;ref name=&quot;CorrellStructuralOptions&quot; /&gt;

Pizza boxes made from solid fibre board take up about half the space the boxes with E flute size cardboard need, and a quarter of the space of those made of B flute size cardboard. Apart from the material itself, the stability of the box is determined by the form it is folded into. The type of pizza box with flaps firmly attached to the side walls that are folded into the front wall has established itself as the standard. In this case, the walls of the box are connected at the edges and this increases its stability. The traditional way of folding the box is an example of this folding type. Its disadvantage is that the walls of the box rise vertically which makes cutting the pizza in the box with a [[pizza cutter]] more difficult.

=== Heat insulation and humidity regulation ===
[[File:Pizzakarton Lueftungsoeffnung 2011.jpg|thumb|left|The opening on the side of the box allows water to evaporate]]
The pizza box is supposed to allow the transport of a baked pizza with the minimum loss in quality possible. This means the box has two tasks to fulfill that are not easy to combine: On the one hand, the box should [[Thermal insulation|insulate]] as well as possible against the cold air outside, the occasional wind and heat radiation, in order to keep the pizza warm. To reduce heat flow the box has to close as firmly as possible to keep the warm air inside. Consumers consider a temperature between 70 and 85&amp;nbsp;°C to be ideal for pizza consumption. On the other hand, the box should keep the pizza from getting soggy, so that the crust and the covering are crisp on arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Patrizia Fava|Surname2=Luciano Piergiovanni|Surname3=Ella Pagliarini|Periodical=Packaging Technology and Science|Title=Design of a functional box for take-away pizza |Volume=12|Issue=2|Publisher=Wiley|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;57–65|ISSN=1099-1522|language=German|DOI=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1522(199903/04)12:2&lt;57::AID-PTS447&gt;3.0.CO;2-R}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure this, the condesation caused by the pizza must be let out (airing holes and some diffusion through the cardboard) or absorbed by the box. Pizza boxes made of single wall corrugated board that are not equipped with additional insulation cool the transported pizza down too far after just ten minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Patrizia Fava|Surname2=Luciano Piergiovanni|Surname3=Ella Pagliarini|Periodical=Packaging Technology and Science|Title=Design of a functional box for take-away pizza |Volume=12|Issue=2|Publisher=Wiley|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;57–65|ISSN=1099-1522|language=German|DOI=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1522(199903/04)12:2&lt;57::AID-PTS447&gt;3.0.CO;2-R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil in the pizza dough can extract some of the essence in the cellulose when in contact with untreated corrugated cardboard. To prevent a change in the taste of the pizza through the material of the pizza box and simultaneously to stop the cardboard from getting soggy the pizza boxes have a thin coating of aluminium foil on the inside. Another possibility is to lay the pizza on aluminium foil, a mixture of corrugated cardboard and blotting paper, or waxed paper. However, this changes the thermodynamic properties of the pizza box considerably. The pizza crust cannot give up any humidity downwards, meaning the layer beneath does not only impede fat from trickling down but also steam.

== For pizza delivery ==

=== Pizza saver ===
{{main article|Pizza saver}}
In the US, many pizza boxes include a spacer made of heat-resistant plastic (usually ([[polypropylene]]) placed in the middle of the pizza. It is called the 'pizza saver' (also known as 'package saver', 'box tent', 'pizza table' or 'pizza lid support').&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blpackagesaver.htm About.com: Package Saver].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkleysquare.net/berkleysquare/pizza_lid_supports.php Produktbeschreibung: Pizza Lid Support].&lt;/ref&gt;
This stops the box lid from touching the pizza and prevents toppings (such as cheese) from sticking to the lid when it is being delivered.&lt;ref name=&quot;mad&quot;&gt;Alexis Madrigal: [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/07/the-3-big-advances-in-the-technology-of-the-pizza-box/242116/ ''The 3 Big Advances in the Technology of the Pizza Box'']. In: ''The Atlantic''. 18. Juli 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
The 'pizza saver's' origin goes back to a 1985 patent, taken out by the American [[Carmela Vitale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pet&quot;&gt;Henry Petroski: ''[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/4/a-round-pie-in-a-square-box/1 A Round Pie in a Square Box.]'' In: ''American Scientist.'' Juli–August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=4498586&amp;KC=&amp;FT=E&amp;locale=en_EP Europäisches Patentamt], retrieved, 26 October 2011 (Englishmen).&lt;/ref&gt; The little piece of plastic called the spacer is often criticized for being a waste of resources as it is only used once and then thrown away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myplasticfreelife.com/2010/05/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-plastic-thing-in-the-middle-of-the-pizza Kritik am Pizza saver] (englisch).&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, ideas for its [[reuse]] are being developed.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Bags and boxes for transport ===
[[File:Domino's Pizza Motor Bikes.jpg|thumb|Domino's Pizza motor bikes that are used for pizza home delivery in Goa, India, with transport boxes mounted atop]]
There are special padded transport bags and boxes for the delivery of pizzas in pizza boxes that are fitted to the typical sizes of pizza boxes. Some of these bags can be heated in order to keep the temperature at the desired level. Mostly, they can either be plugged to a socket or powered by the 12 volt car battery. This means that the insulation of pizza boxes themselves is less important.
Pizza boxes with pizzas inside should be held horizontally at all times and should be protected against high acceleration to the sides and impact. To ensure this, there are usually handles on either side of the carry bags for carrying. Combined, these handles allow the box to be carried in one hand by the side of the body. Carry bags insulate best when their lid is connected to the rest of the bag on one side and the remaining three sides can be attached to lid by a zip. A bag can contain about three to five pizza boxes, which is usually enough for one delivery address. If more pizzas have to be delivered a higher bag is used or two regular bags are placed on top of each other and carried with both hands in front of the body.

=== Pizza box with thermometer ===
The pizza boxes by [[Pizza Hut]] in [[Morocco]] and other countries have a [[thermometer]] indicator on the outside which colour codes the temperature of the pizza inside, letting the outside world know about what is going on inside. When the pizza is hot the indicator shows the words 'HOT' in red letters on a white background. However, if the temperature of the pizza goes below a certain value the 'Hot Dot' turns black and the words are not longer legible. If the pizza is delivered to the receiver cold, then the next delivery is free of charge. The thermondicator is intended for one use only.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wiemer: [http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2011/04/take-a-tour-of-pizza-boxes-of-the-world.html?ref=excerpt_readmore ''Take a ‘Tour’ of Pizza Boxes of the World''], privates Video über besondere Pizzakartons aus verschiedenen Ländern (Englisch), retrieved, 15 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Safety &amp; Hygiene Thermometers &amp; Temperature Indicators|trans-title=|periodical=www.lcrhallcrest.com|publisher=|url=http://www.lcrhallcrest.com/food-hygiene-products/case-studies.php?id=8|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2016-02-25|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible contaminations ==

=== 2,6-Diisopropylnaphthalene (2,6-DIPN) ===
[[DIPN]] is used as a solvent in certain kinds of paper. These can be part of scrap paper which is used in the manufacturing of packaging like the pizza box. Direct contact or evaporation can transfer DIPN from the packaging onto the packed food, contaminating it. Especially food containing fat like pizza with a layer of cheese can absorb DIPN.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAVES&quot;&gt;Niedersächsischen Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit: [http://www.laves.niedersachsen.de/portal/live.php?navigation_id=20045&amp;article_id=73005&amp;_psmand=23 Kernlösemittel DIPN in Verpackungen: 8 von 128 Proben beanstandet], Presseinformation Nr. 063. 17 December 2004. Accessed 5 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, there is no knowledge of danger to the health of the consumer. Still, paper contaminated with DIPN must not be used in the food sector in order to minimise danger of contamination.&lt;ref&gt;Bericht über die 109.

Typically, a pizza that is 10 to 14 inches wide will feed two people, assuming the party-goers are not voraciously hungry.&lt;ref name=awesome&gt;Knudson, Pamela.

When a pizza party does not include any custom-made pizzas, and the particular preferences of the guests are unknown, it is common to include at least one plain cheese-only or vegetable-only pizza for people who are averse to meats or other available toppings.&lt;ref&gt;Hulin, Belinda.

{{pizza}}

During the latter half of the 20th century, [[pizza]] became a globally accessible dish, mainly due to [[Italian immigrants]] that had brought their dishes to new people with resounding success, often in racially and culturally resistive environments.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

A survey from 2004 showed that [[Norwegians]] eat the most frozen pizza (5.4&amp;nbsp;kg/person*year), followed by [[Germans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/norrmannen-varldsbast-pa-att-ata-pizza_1042389.svd|title=Norrmännen världsbäst på att äta pizza|author=Maria Wahlberg|date=13 January 2005|work=SvD.se|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asia ==

=== Bangladesh ===
Pizza became a popular fast food in [[Bangladesh]]i urban areas. Since the introduction of various pizza brands such as [[Domino's]] and [[Pizza Hut]] in the early to mid-2000s, it has reached almost all classes of urban peoples.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== India ===
[[File:Tandoori Paneer from India.jpg|thumb|A [[Tandoor]]i [[Paneer]] pizza from India.]]
Pizza is an emerging fast food in [[India]]n urban areas. American pizza chains [[Domino's Pizza]] and [[Pizza Hut]] opened their first outlets in India in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/company-facts/jubilantfoodworks/history/JF04 |title=Company History of Jubilant Foodworks |publisher=Moneycontrol.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Kretzmann&quot;/&gt; Domestic pizza brands include U.S.Pizza, [[Smokin' Joes]] and [[Pizza Corner]]. Branded pizza is available in most cities in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;jubilantfoodworks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jubilantfoodworks.com/brand/|title=Brand - Jubilant FoodWorks Ltd - JFL &amp;#124; Dunkin' Donut &amp;#124; Domino's Pizza &amp;#124; Jubilant FoodWorks Limited|publisher=jubilantfoodworks.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizzas served in India by foreign pizza brands feature greater &quot;recipe localization&quot; from pizza makers than many other markets such as Latin America and Europe, but similar to other Asian pizza markets. Indian pizzas are generally spicier and more vegetable-oriented than those in other countries. For instance, oregano spice packs are included with a typical pizza order in India instead of Parmesan cheese.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kretzmann&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kretzmann |first=David |url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/21/how-dominos-is-poised-to-benefit-from-india.aspx |title=How Domino's Is Poised to Benefit From India |publisher=Fool.com |date=2013-12-21 |accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to spicier and more vegetable-oriented ingredients, Indian pizza also utilized unique toppings. For example, a pizza topping unique to India would be pickled ginger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thornhill, Jan 2010&quot;&gt;Thornhill, Jan. Who Wants Pizza?: The Kids' Guide to the History, Science &amp; Culture of Food. Toronto: Maple Tree, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizza outlets serve pizzas with several Indian-style toppings, such as tandoori chicken and [[paneer]]. More conventional pizzas are also eaten. Pizzas available in India range from localized basic variants, available in neighborhood bakeries, to gourmet pizzas with exotic and imported ingredients available at specialty restaurants.

=== Japan ===
American pizza chains entered [[Japan]] in the 1970s (e.g. [[Shakey's Pizza]] and Pizza Hut 1973, Domino's pizza in 1985). The largest Japanese pizza chain is [[Pizza-La]]. Local types of pizza are popular, with many using mayonnaise sauces, and sometimes other ingredients such as corn, potatoes, avocado, eel, or even honey or chocolate (as in dessert). &quot;Side orders&quot; also often include items such as french fries, fried chicken, baked pasta, as well as vegetable soups, green salads, desserts, and soda or Japanese tea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pizza-la.co.jp/sc_englishmenu.aspx PizzaLa English menu Retrieved 2014-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a strong tradition of using [[Tabasco sauce]] on cooked pizzas.

Pizza toppings in Japan also differ from that found in the United States. One of the unique pizza toppings found in Japan is squid. Seafood may be found on pizza everywhere, but having squid as the focal ingredient is unique to Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thornhill, Jan 2010&quot;/&gt;

Local crust variants also exist, for instance mochi pizza (crust made with Japanese [[mochi]] cakes).&lt;ref&gt;Ceccarini R.

=== Korea ===
Pizza is a popular snack food in [[South Korea]], especially among younger people.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Major American brands such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and [[Papa John's Pizza]] compete against domestic brands such as [[Mr. Pizza Korea|Mr. Pizza]] and [[Pizza Etang]], offering traditional as well as local varieties which may include toppings such as [[bulgogi]] and [[dak galbi]]. Korean-style pizza tends to be complicated, and often has nontraditional toppings such as corn, potato wedges, sweet potato, shrimp, or crab. Traditional Italian-style thin-crust pizza is served in the many Italian restaurants in [[Seoul]] and other major cities. 
[[North Korea]]'s first pizzeria opened in its capital [[Pyongyang]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7945816.stm | work=BBC News | title=First North Korean pizzeria opens | date=2009-03-16 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizza has gained a measure of popularity in the eastern regions of Pakistan—namely, the provinces of [[Sindh]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], and [[P.O.K]], as well as the autonomous territory of [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]. Pizza has not penetrated into western Pakistan; of the remaining provinces and territories of Pakistan, only one ([[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]) has seen much of the dish, in the form of a single [[Pizza Hut]] in [[Peshawar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/food-beverage/restaurants-food-service-restaurants-fast/8006760-1.html |title=Foreign food franchises.

Authentic [[Neapolitan pizza]]s (''pizza napoletana'') are typically made with tomatoes and [[mozzarella]] cheese. They can be made with ingredients like [[San Marzano tomato]]es, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of [[Mount Vesuvius]], and [[Buffalo Mozzarella|mozzarella di bufala Campana]], made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of [[Campania]] and [[Lazio]] in a semi-wild state (this mozzarella is protected with its own European [[protected designation of origin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/qual/it/147_it.htm |title=Selezione geografica |publisher=Europa.eu.int |date=2009-02-23 |accessdate=2009-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050218123118/http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/qual/it/147_it.htm |archivedate=2005-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For proper results, strong flour with high protein content (as used for bread-making rather than cakes) must be used. The dough must be kneaded by hand or with a low-speed mixer. After the rising process, the dough must be formed by hand without the help of a rolling pin or other machine, and may be no more than {{convert|3|mm|in|sp=us}} thick.

Pizza in [[Lazio]] ([[Rome]]), as well as in many other parts of Italy, is available in two different styles. Take-away shops sell ''pizza rustica'' or ''[[pizza al taglio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPwjiocwXFwC&amp;pg=PP37&amp;dq=Lazio,+pizza+al+taglio |title=Lonely Planet Rome | authors = Duncan Garwood, Abigail Hole |publisher=Lonely Planet |date= 2012-05-01|accessdate=2013-07-04|isbn=9781742208428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pizza is cooked in long, rectangular baking pans and relatively thick (1–2&amp;nbsp;cm). The pizza is often cooked in an electric oven. It is usually cut with scissors or a knife and sold by weight. In pizzerias, pizza is served in a dish in its traditional round shape. It has a thin, crisp base quite different from the thicker and softer Neapolitan style base. It is usually cooked in a [[wood-fired oven]], giving the pizza its unique flavor and texture. In Rome, a ''[[pizza napoletana]]'' is topped with tomato, mozzarella, anchovies and oil (thus, what in [[Naples]] is called ''pizza romana'', in Rome is called ''pizza napoletana''). Other types of Lazio-style pizza include

There was a bill before the [[Italian Parliament]] in 2002 to safeguard the ''traditional Italian pizza'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/showText?tipodoc=Ddlpres&amp;leg=13&amp;id=00007353&amp;offset=4504&amp;length=6529 |title=Bill for traditional Italian pizza |publisher=Senato.it |date= |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifying permissible ingredients and methods of processing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senato.it/leg/13/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/testi/13214_testi.htm |title=Permissible ingredients and methods of processing |publisher=Senato.it |date= |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., excluding frozen pizzas). Only pizzas which followed these guidelines could be called &quot;traditional Italian pizzas&quot; in Italy. On 9 December 2009, the [[European Union]], upon Italian request, granted [[Traditional Speciality Guaranteed]] (TSG) safeguard to traditional Neapolitan pizza, in particular to &quot;Margherita&quot; and &quot;Marinara&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110715092118/http://www.pizzamarketplace.com/article/96776/EU-grants-Neapolitan-pizza-Traditional-Specialty-Guaranteed-label EU grants Neapolitan pizza Traditional Specialty Guaranteed label], Pizza Marketplace&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union enacted a [[protected designation of origin]] system in the 1990s.

=== Malta ===
The Maltese enjoy eating Italian style pizza and fast-food pizzas, as well as experimenting with various toppings, including local produce. One style of fast-food pizza is the typical ''pizza kwadra'' (square pizza), which is found in [[Pastizzi]] shops (''pastizzeriji''), a deep-[[pan pizza]] cut into squares, generally topped with either green olives (''taż-żebbuġ''), hard boiled egg and cocktail sausage (''bajd u zalzett''), or chicken and barbecue sauce (''tat-tiġieġ''). A typical ''Pizzerija'' restaurant will offer a vast number of different pizza recipes, mostly based on the Italian style ones. A typical menu would include:
* '''Margherita:''' [[tomato sauce]], [[mozzarella]]
* '''Funghi:''' tomato sauce, mozzarella, [[mushroom]]s
* '''Capricciosa:''' tomato sauce, mozzarella, mushrooms, [[ham]], [[egg]]s, [[artichoke]], [[cocktail sausage]]s, [[green olive]]s
* '''Quattro Stagioni:''' tomato sauce, mozzarella, ham, [[black olive]]s, mushrooms, artichoke, [[peas]], [[salami]], eggs
* '''Vegetariana:''' tomato sauce, mozzarella, mushrooms, onion, (artichoke), [[sweet corn]], [[Bell pepper|green peppers]],
* '''Quattro Formaggi:''' tomato sauce, and 4 assorted cheeses, generally mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, blue cheese, and goat cheese, but may vary
* '''Marinara:''' tomato sauce, mozzarella, shrimps, mussels, [[tuna]], [[calamari]], [[crab meat]]
* '''Peperoni:''' tomato sauce, mozzarella, [[peperoni]]
* '''Napolitana:''' tomato sauce, [[anchovies]], [[olive]]s, capers
* '''Hawaii:''' tomato sauce, mozzarella, ham, pineapple
* '''Maltija (''Maltese''):''' tomato sauce, goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, Maltese sausage, onion

* '''Rucola:''' tomato sauce, mozzarella di bufala, parma ham, Parmesan shavings, rucola
* '''Bolognese:''' tomato sauce, mozzarella, [[mincing|minced]] meat, onion, (fresh tomato)
* '''Meat Feast:''' tomato sauce, mozzarella, minced meat, Maltese sausage, and other meat
* '''Kebabpizza:''' tomato sauce, mozzarella, [[Doner kebab|döner kebab]], onion, green [[peperoncini]], (kebab sauce poured over after baking)
* '''Mexicana:''' tomato sauce, mozzarella, various recipes with minced beef, [[jalapeño]]s, sweet corn, onion, spicy sauce and other hot ingredients

Pizza has become a household dish. Nevertheless, the traditional Maltese pizza consists of a typical Maltese [[ftira]] covered in cheese (mainly local [[gbejna]]), onions and potatoes. In fact, it is most often known simply as &quot;ftira&quot; and is mainly sold on the island of [[Gozo]]. Different toppings can be added, including tuna, olives, anchovies, sundried tomatoes, and even traditional Maltese sausage.

=== Norway ===
Norwegians eat the most pizza in the world according to a 2004 survey by [[ACNielsen]] 2004, 5,4&amp;nbsp;kg/year per capita. 50&amp;nbsp;million frozen pizzas were sold that year, with consumption being 22,000 [[ton]]s of frozen pizza, 15,000 tons of home-baked and 13,000 tons of restaurant-made pizzas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/norrmannen-varldsbast-pa-att-ata-pizza_1042389.svd|title=Svenska dagbladet: Pizza statistics according to AC Nielsen|work=SvD.se|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By far the most popular is the frozen pizza [[Grandiosa]], every other pizza sold, frozen or fresh is a Pizza Grandiosa. Since its start in 1980 the Grandiosa has been part of Norwegian modern culture and trends, going so far to be unofficial called &quot;The national dish of Norway&quot;.

Norway also has a traditional home-made pizza called &quot;lørdagspizza&quot; (literally translates to &quot;Saturday pizza&quot;). The dough is shaped to the pan (usually rectangular), then a mix of minced meat and tomato sauce follows. Finally it is gratinated with a generous amount of cheese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.side2.no/foreldre/19-ting-barna-dine-aldri-vil-forsta/8483346.html|title=19 ting barna dine aldri vil forstå|last=Aabel|first=Suzanne|work=Side2|access-date=2017-06-14|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.godt.no/oppskrift/1430/geir-skeies-langpannepizza-med-pizzasalat|title=Godt.no - Finn noe godt å spise|website=Godt.no|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
[[File:Pizza bella vista.jpg|thumb|Pizza prepared in [[Swedish cuisine|Sweden]]]]

Pizza arrived in [[Sweden]] with Italian guest workers and became popular around 1970. Swedish pizza is mainly of the Neapolitan type and most pizzerias in Sweden have Margherita, Capricciosa and Quattro Stagioni pizzas at the top of the menu, although with altered recipes. For example, a Swedish Margherita uses Swedish hard cheese instead of mozzarella and dried [[oregano]] instead of fresh basil. The Swedish pizza has been developed with lots of innovations and styles, creating a tradition distinct from the Italian one, although some names may overlap. Occasionally pizzerias offer &quot;Italian pizza&quot; imitating Italian recipes in addition to the Swedish ones.

A typical Swedish pizzeria offers 40-50 different named varieties on the menu, even up to 100, and personal modifications are allowed. Also, many pizzerias also serve [[salad]]s, [[lasagne]], [[kebab]] and [[hamburger]]s, especially if there is a facility to sit and eat. Italian style restaurants often combine a restaurant menu with a pizza menu.

Some popular varieties common in most of Sweden, mostly with the same name, all having tomato sauce and cheese to start with and additional toppings:
* Africana: ham/beef/chicken, banana, pineapple, onion, [[curry powder]]
* Bolognese: [[Ground meat|minced]] meat, onion, (fresh tomato)
* Calzone (folded): ham
* Capricciosa: [[mushroom]]s, [[ham]]
* Ciao-ciao (folded): beef, [[garlic]], (onion)
* Frutti di mare: [[tuna]], shrimp, mussels
* Hawaii: ham, pineapple
* Kebabpizza: [[Doner kebab#Sweden|döner kebab]], onion, green [[peperoncini]], (kebab sauce poured over after baking)
* Marinara: shrimp, mussels
* Mexicana: various recipes with minced beef, [[jalapeño]]s, onion, spicy sauce and other spicy ingredients
* Napolitana: [[anchovies]], [[olive]]s, capers
* Quattro Stagioni: ham, [[shrimp]], ([[mussel]]s), mushrooms, [[artichoke]]
* Vegetariana: mushrooms, onion, ([[pineapple]]), ([[artichoke]]s), ([[asparagus]]), ([[red bell pepper]])
* other varieties with [[fillet (cut)|filet]] of beef or pork and [[béarnaise sauce]] and onion

Perhaps the most extreme pizza sort heard of in Sweden is the Calskrove or Calzskrove (a portmanteau of [[calzone]] and &quot;skrovmål&quot; meaning &quot;big meal&quot; but also Northern slang for &quot;hamburger meal&quot;), sold at some pizzerias in northern Sweden, a complete meal of a 150 or 250 grams hamburger with bread and all regular toppings, and chips (french fries), baked into a regular Calzone with ham as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsterpizzan|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/matvin/article11029191.ab|work=Aftonbladet|accessdate=3 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106085616/http://www.aftonbladet.se/matvin/article11029191.ab|archivedate=6 January 2016|language=Swedish|date=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular types of pizza in Sweden since the 1990s is kebab-pizza, and a song in the Swedish [[Melodifestivalen]] 2008 was &quot;Kebabpizza [[slivovitz]]a&quot;. The invention is most likely the result of the common tendency of pizza bakers to create their own flagship compositions and novel flavors, using whatever might be available in their kitchen. In recent years one can find pizza with fresh lettuce or chips ([[French fries]]) put on top after baking. The amount of topping compared to the crust is rather high by international standards.

The typical side order with Swedish pizza is a free &quot;pizza salad&quot;. 1969 Giuseppe &quot;Peppino&quot; Sperandio opened &quot;Pizzeria Piazza Opera&quot;, one of the first restaurants only serving pizza in Stockholm, Sweden. Sperandio was born in northeast Italy where a cabbage salad called &quot;kupus salata&quot; was a very common dish, from bordering country Croatia. This salad from his childhood, was offered as a free side dish. Eaten, while waiting for the pizza to be baked. Sperandio became Stockholm's pizza king and had during his hey day more than 30 pizza restaurants. Today this Balkan salad (renamed to pizza salad), is as Swedish as the Dala horse.
The pizza salad is made with shredded [[cabbage]], coarse [[Black pepper|pepper]] and sometimes [[red bell pepper]], slightly pickled ([[Fermentation (food)|fermented]]) in [[vinaigrette]] for a few days.

In general, Swedish pizzerias are private [[Business|enterprises]] and not [[franchising|franchise]], often owned as a family business by immigrants, but very seldom Italians. Of international [[restaurant chain]]s only [[Pizza Hut]] is well established, although [[Vapiano]] has a few restaurants in [[Stockholm]] and [[Domino's]] have been trying to establish itself in southern Sweden since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dominos.se/|title=Dominos.se (Swedish)|accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many pizzerias offer affordable (about 1-2 € total, or free with large order) home delivery in less than 30 minutes and many are connected to an on-line ordering service. The take-away price of one standard size (30&amp;nbsp;cm) pizza is 5 to 8 € depending on topping, about the double for a &quot;family pizza&quot; of double size (weight), and about the half for a &quot;children's pizza&quot; (mostly served in restaurants). Pizza has become a staple food in Sweden (1,1&amp;nbsp;kg/year), although most people prepare their own food, as home cooking skills generally are good, and is largely considered as an acceptable occasional fast food alternative to a proper meal.

=== United Kingdom ===
Since the 1980s, a wide variety of pizzas ranging from fairly authentic Italian to American style to the mass-processed varieties are widely available and pizzas are also commonly made at home with children using local substitutions such as [[bacon]] for [[prosciutto]] and [[cheddar cheese|cheddar]] for [[mozzarella]]. Dough bases vary widely from homemade [[scone]] doughs to thin Roman-style and thick American stuffed-crust types. The typical British high-street now has a variety of international Italian- and American-style pizza chains, including homegrown chains [[PizzaExpress]], [[Strada]] and [[Prezzo]] as well as Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's alongside much more authentic independent Italian-run restaurants with wood-fired ovens particularly in large cities such as London. Unique spicy varieties enjoy some popularity, including [[Chicken tikka masala]] or other curry toppings, chilli pizzas and a typical mid-range restaurant or takeaway will usually have versions of such standard &quot;Italian-American&quot; combinations as 'Hawaiian' (ham and pineapple); 'Peperroni' (spicy salami) and 'Meat Feast' (a mix of meats and salami) and a 'Vegeteriana' options. Non-Italian varieties are common too, for example, [[lahmacun]] called 'Turkish pizzas', or Alsatian '[[Tarte flambée|Flammkuchen]]'. In some parts of [[Scotland]] you can get a [[deep-fried pizza]] from [[fish and chips|Fish and Chip]] shops. A frozen pizza, whole or half, dipped in batter and deep fried. It is usually served with in the same manner as any other fried item from these shops.

===Iceland===
Iceland has all of the typical pizza toppings you would expect like pepperoni and sausage but also have some unique ones. A pizza topping that is found in Iceland that may not be found elsewhere would be bananas. Bananas are used as toppings across the country showing how they have created their own version of an Italian classic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thornhill, Jan 2010&quot;/&gt;

== Middle East ==
[[File:Israeli Pizza w Corn BRiboa 3124.jpg|thumb|Pizza with corn and [[za'atar]] in [[Kfar Saba]], [[Israel]]]]

=== Israel ===
Many [[Israel]]i and American pizza stores and chains, including Pizza Hut and [[Sbarro]], have both [[kashrut|kosher]] and non-kosher locations.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Kosher locations either have no meat or use imitation meat because of the Jewish religious dietary prohibition against mixing meat with dairy products, such as cheese. Kosher pizza locations must also close during the holiday of [[Passover]], when no [[leavened bread]] is allowed in kosher locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klingbail |first=Sivan |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/pizza-hut-revamps-to-survive-1.157518 |title=Pizza Hut revamps to survive |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2005-05-03 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Israeli pizza differs from pizza in other countries because of the very large portions of vegetable toppings such as mushrooms or onions, and some unusual toppings, like corn or [[Strained yogurt|labane]], and middle-Eastern spices, such as [[za'atar]]. Like most foods in Israel, pizza choices reflect multiple cultures.

=== Turkey ===
Pizza establishments in [[Turkey]] are a mixture of local restaurants, local chains (e.g. Pizza Max), and international chains like [[Pizza Hut]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Little Caesars]], and [[Sbarro]]. While most combinations of toppings reflect common ingredients found in the US and Italy, there are additional ingredients available that cater to traditional tastes as well, such as minced beef, spicy [[Sucuk]] sausage, cured meats like [[Pastırma]], cheeses like [[Kaşar]] and [[Beyaz peynir|Beyaz]], and local olives and herbs. With the exception of some restaurants, pork products like ham and bacon are not available, which are substituted with beef, chicken, or lamb equivalents.

Pizza has several equivalent or similar dishes in traditional [[Turkish cuisine]], such as Black-Sea-style or Bafra-style [[Pita|Pide]] and [[Lahmacun]], which adds to the popularity of the dish across Turkey.

== North America ==

=== Mexico ===

'''Mexican pizza''' is a pizza made with ingredients typical of [[Mexican cuisine]]. The usual toppings that can be found throughout Mexico are [[chorizo]], [[jalapeño]] pepper slices, grilled or fried onions, tomato, [[chile]], [[shrimp]], [[avocado]], and sometimes beef, [[bell peppers]], [[tripas]] or [[scallop]]. This pizza has the usual [[marinara sauce]] or [[Alfredo sauce|white sauce]] and [[mozzarella cheese]]. Variations, substituting [[pepper jack cheese]] or [[Oaxaca cheese]] for mozzarella, are also popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCF4hP1EmrsC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=mexican+pizza&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9NPVUZPyOOf0iQKO6oGgDA&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ |title=Fast Food Fix: 75+ Amazing Recipe Makeovers of Your Fast Food Restaurant Favorites | first = Devin | last = Alexander |publisher= |date=2006-04-18 |pages=164–165|accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the first pizza establishment in the [[United States]] was opened in [[New York City|New York's]] [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Eric |last=Asimov |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/10/dining/new-york-pizza-the-real-thing-makes-a-comeback.html |title=New York Pizza, the Real Thing, Makes a Comeback |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 10, 1998 |accessdate=2006-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the influx of Italian immigrants, the U.S. has developed regional forms of pizza, some bearing only a casual resemblance to the Italian original. [[Chicago]] has its own style of a [[Chicago deep dish pizza|deep-dish pizza]] and New York City's style of pizza are well-known. [[New York-style pizza]] refers to the thin crust pizza popular in the states of New York, [[New Jersey]], and [[Connecticut]].  [[Philadelphia]] provides sauce on top of the cheese; [[St. Louis]] and other Midwest pizzas use thin crusts and rectangular slices in its [[St. Louis-style pizza|local pizzas]]. [[Detroit-style pizza]] is a square pizza that has a thick deep-dish crisp crust, and is generally served with the sauce on top of the cheese. The square shape is the result of an early tradition of using metal trays originally meant to hold small parts in factories. The [[jumbo slice]] is an oversized [[New York-style pizza]] sold by the slice to go, especially in the [[Adams Morgan]] neighborhood in Washington, D.C. The [[Clam pie#White clam pie|white clam pie]] is a pizza variety that originated at the [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana]] restaurant in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Barrett | first=L. | last2=Abate | first2=L. | last3=Caporuscio | first3=R. | last4=Bello | first4=M. | last5=Bruno | first5=S. | title=Pizza, A Slice of American History | publisher=Voyageur Press | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-7603-4560-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPCuBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58 | page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===

The usual Italian varieties are available, though more common is the style popular in the U.S., with more and richer toppings than Italian style. A common unique type is the '''Aussie''', '''Australian''' or '''Australiana''', which has the usual tomato base or a seasoned base and mozzarella cheese with options of chicken, ham, bacon and egg (seen as quintessentially Australian breakfast fare). Pizzas with seafood such as [[prawns]] are also popular. In the 1980s some [[Australian]] pizza shops and restaurants began selling &quot;gourmet pizzas&quot;, that is, pizzas with more expensive ingredients such as salmon, dill, [[bocconcini]], tiger prawns, or unconventional toppings such as [[kangaroo meat]], [[emu]] and [[crocodile]]. &quot;Wood-fired pizzas&quot;, that is, those cooked in a ceramic oven heated by [[wood fuel]], are well-regarded.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Franchised chains coexists with independent pizzerias, Middle-Eastern bakeries and kebabs shops.

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand's first dedicated pizza outlet was [[1974 in New Zealand#Events|opened]] by Pizza Hut in New Lynn in 1974, with Dominos following. One notable indigenous chain is [[Hell Pizza]] established in 1996 - which now has outlets worldwide - distinguishing itself by often-controversial marketing and using only free-range ingredients. Independent restaurants are common.

New Zealand has no rules for pizza construction, leading to an eclectic and varied approach to toppings. Gourmet and &quot;wild&quot; ingredients are often used, and New Zealanders are apt to push the boundaries of what a pizza can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anything Goes : Pizza In New Zealand|url=https://www.dinein.co.nz/cms/anything-goes-pizza-in-new-zealand/|website=Dine In|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South America ==

=== Argentina ===

Standard Argentine pizza has a thicker crust than traditional Italian style pizza and includes more cheese. Pizza is made with very thin, and sometimes thick, high-rising [[dough]]s, with or without [[cheese]], cooked in the [[oven]] or ''a la piedra'' (on a [[stone oven]]), and stuffed with numerous ingredients -— is a dish which can be found in nearly every corner of the  country. [[Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario]], and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] also serve it with [[fainá]], which is a chick pea-flour dough placed over the piece of pizza. People say that what makes the Argentine pizza unique is the blending of Italian and Spanish cultures. At the turn of the 19th century, immigrants from [[Naples]] and [[Genoa]] opened the first pizza bars, though Spanish residents subsequently owned most of the pizza businesses.
Another very popular kind is the fugazza, which consists in a regular pizza crust topped with onions, ground black pepper, olive oil and mozzarella cheese (in this case it is called fugazzeta).

=== Brazil ===
[[File:Chocolate Pizza.JPG|thumb|[[Chocolate pizza]] served as a dessert at a restaurant in [[Brazil]]]]

[[São Paulo]] has 6,000 pizza establishments and 1.4&amp;nbsp;million pizzas are consumed daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indexet.gazetamercantil.com.br/arquivo/2007/07/10/330/Capital-da-pizza,-sabores-para-todos.html |title=Capital da pizza, sabores para todos |publisher= Gazeta Mercantil |date= |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the first [[Brazil]]ian pizzas were baked in the Brás district of São Paulo in the late part of the 19th century. Until the 1940s, almost only found in the Italian communities around the country. Since then, pizza became increasingly popular among the rest of the population. The most traditional pizzerias are still found in the Italian neighborhoods, such as Bexiga (official name: Bela Vista). Both Neapolitan (thick crust) and Roman (thin crust) varieties are common in Brazil, with traditional versions using tomato sauce and mozzarella as a base. Brazilian pizza in general, though, tends to have less tomato sauce than the authentic (Italian) pizza, or uses slices of tomato in place of sauce. Brazilian pizzerias offer also Brazilian variants such as &quot;pizza com [[catupiry]]&quot;. July 10 is &quot;Pizza Day&quot; in São Paulo, marking the final day of an annual competition among &quot;pizzaiolos&quot;. In Brazil, pizza quatro queijos (''pizza quattro formaggi'') uses [[mozzarella]], [[provolone]], [[parmesan]] and [[gorgonzola]], and there is also a variety with five cheeses, which adds [[catupiry]].

=== Colombia ===

&quot;[[Hawaiian pizza]]&quot; is popular in Colombia.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The pizza is topped with ham and pineapple.

The presence of pizza [[restaurant chain]]s has contributed to a significant increase in [[pizza]] consumption in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;French Crabbe 2010&quot;/&gt; This also had an effect of introducing [[cheese]] as a culinary ingredient and everyday food in China, which was relatively uncommon in Chinese cuisine prior to the emergence of pizza chains.&lt;ref name=&quot;French Crabbe 2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts 2016&quot;/&gt; [[Pizza Hut]] opened its first store in China in 1990,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 2011&quot;/&gt; and several pizza restaurant chains exist in China today.

===Early history===
[[Pizza Hut]] opened its first store in China in 1990, and Pizza Hut and [[Domino's Pizza]] both expanded in the Chinese market in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan Zakkour 2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 2016&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts 2016&quot;/&gt; Prior to entering the market, Pizza Hut performed market analysis and research into consumer food preferences, tastes, and dining habits, whereas Domino's simply entered the market providing their standard fare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan Zakkour 2014&quot;/&gt; With its planning and research, Pizza Hut was successful in its endeavors, opening over 1,300 stores in the country, whereas Domino's was rather unsuccessful, with under 40 stores in China in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan Zakkour 2014&quot;/&gt; At the time, Domino's provided the company's [[pizza delivery|delivery]] guarantee of thirty minutes or less, but did not take into account many Chinese cities' heavy vehicle traffic and [[gridlock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan Zakkour 2014&quot;/&gt; Domino's lack of success in the Chinese market has also been attributed to the chain's fare lacking appeal to Chinese consumers, not having sit-down restaurants (Domino's stores were take-out and delivery only), and the large size of the company's pizzas, which made them difficult for consumers to eat while walking or hanging out on the street.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan Zakkour 2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sozzi 2015&quot;/&gt;

Prior to establishing restaurants in China, [[Pizza Hut]] management was told by experts that many Chinese consumers do not like cheese and [[Lactose_intolerance#Epidemiology|may not be able to digest it]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahlstrom Bruton 2009&quot;/&gt;{{efn|&quot;... cheese is not traditionally a part of the Chinese diet, with many Chinese being [[Lactose intolerance|lactose-intolerant]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sozzi 2015&quot;/&gt;}} The company's management was also informed that tomato is not a culinary ingredient in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahlstrom Bruton 2009&quot;/&gt; Per these factors, Pizza Hut was warned that Chinese consumers would not eat pizza.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahlstrom Bruton 2009&quot;/&gt; In response to this, Pizza Hut modified their pizza recipes, using less tomato sauce and cheese and including indigenous ingredients that were agreeable to Chinese consumers, such as tuna, crab sticks, soy sauce, chicken and corn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahlstrom Bruton 2009&quot;/&gt; The company also created new pizzas for the Chinese market, such as the Homemade Sweet and Creamy, which resembles apple turnovers, and the [[Thousand Island dressing]] pizza, which lacked tomato sauce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahlstrom Bruton 2009&quot;/&gt; As of 2014, Pizza Hut had over 1,300 stores in China, with a particularly strong presence in [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan Zakkour 2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yu 2012 p. 51&quot;/&gt;
