A '''pizza cutter''' (also known as a '''roller blade''' or a '''pizza wheel''') is a [[tool|utensil]] that is used to cut [[pizza]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Murray|title=101 Knife Designs: Practical Knives for Daily Use|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sOjBvs3I29EC&amp;pg=PA22|date=25 June 2013|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-3383-8|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
There are two main types of pizza cutters.
The most common uses a wheel that rotates in a circle while a person moves the cutter in a direction that they would like to cut the pizza.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter2013&quot;/&gt; The other type is a large curved knife called a [[mezzaluna]] (Italian for &quot;half moon&quot;), which is rocked back and forth to cut the pizza. These two types of pizza cutters come in many different sizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosso1985&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosso|first=Julee|title=The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=roluySsfCKQC&amp;pg=PA199|date=January 1985|publisher=Workman Pub.|isbn=978-0-89480-831-9|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people might use the wheel pizza cutter for other things, including [[craft]] work. Some types of [[mezzaluna]]s (particularly the double-bladed type) are often used to mince herbs or chop vegetables.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosso1985&quot;/&gt;

{{pizza}}

A '''pizza saver''' or '''package saver''' (sometimes referred to as pizza table, pizza Ottoman, or pizza nipple) is an object used to prevent the top of a food container, such as a [[pizza box]] or [[cake box]], from collapsing in at the center and touching the food inside.&lt;ref name=petroski&gt;Henry Petroski. [http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/4/a-round-pie-in-a-square-box/1 &quot;A Round Pie in a Square Box&quot;], ''[[American Scientist]]'', July–August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A [[pizza]] saver is made of plastic and has three (sometimes four) legs. They are often white, and the common practice is to place one pizza saver in the center of the pizza before the box lid is closed for [[pizza delivery|delivery]]. The pizza saver is not re-used and is typically discarded by the patron, although some people have found secondary uses for them &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sewmanyways.blogspot.co.at/2011/06/tool-time-tuesdayrecycled-pizza-box.html|title=Tool Time Tuesday...Recycled Pizza Box Support|website=Sewmanyways.blogspot.co.at|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as egg holders when turned upside down.&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt;

In 1985, Carmela Vitale of [[Dix Hills, New York]], was issued a [[patent]] for a plastic 3-legged tripod stool that would sit in the middle of the box and keep the top from sagging into pizza, cakes or other foods kept in a box.&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt; Vitale called her invention a &quot;package saver&quot; and used that term also as the title of her patent, but it has since been renamed the &quot;pizza saver&quot; since that has become its most common use.&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt; The patent (#4,498,586) was filed on February 10, 1983, and issued on February 12, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| inventor-last = Vitale | inventor-first = Carmela | issue-date = 1985 | title = Package saver| country-code = US  | patent-number = 4498586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patent for a similar device, named &quot;Guardapizza&quot;, was filed in 1974 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, by Claudio Daniel Troglia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://portaltramites.inpi.gob.ar/consultasmodelos/Modelos_Resultado?Va=24980&amp;Vb=O&amp;Vc=07] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitiosargentina.com.ar/se-llama-guardapizza-aqui-historia/|title=Se llama guardapizza, aquí su historia|date=1 August 2017|website=Sitiosargentina.com.ar|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations on the device have since been invented by other people, such as a disposable plastic spatula whose handle holds the box top up; and a plastic tripod, like the designs by Vitale and Troglia, but with one of the legs serrated like a knife, making for easy cutting of stuck cheese and bread. &lt;ref name=petroski/&gt;  Some pizzerias have eliminated the use of plastic pizza savers by returning to the old method of simply baking a bread ball into the center of their pizzas.

{{Canadian cuisine}}

'''Pizza-ghetti''' is a [[combination meal]] commonly found in [[fast food]] or [[family restaurants]] throughout the province of [[Quebec]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/encyclopaedia!openframeset&amp;frame=Right&amp;Src=/edible.nsf/pages/pizzaghetti!opendocument Pizzaghetti] description on ''Practically Edible: Web Food Encyclopaedia''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanphoto.net/blog/category/food/ Pizza-ghetti]: a staple item on fast-food menus in Montreal&lt;/ref&gt; and other parts of [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therecord.com/entertainment/dining/dining_375.html Pizza-ghetti in a family restaurant in Waterloo, Ontario], ''Waterloo Region Record'', 13 December 2006. Retrieved on 11 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of a [[pizza]], sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of [[spaghetti]] with a tomato based sauce.  Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of [[Italian cuisine]], combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thewaffle.blog.com/2009/12/18/what-pizzaghetti-was-really-meant-to-be/], ''What Pizzaghetti was meant to be.''. Retrieved on 22 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, especially in the United States, ''pizza-ghetti'' refers to a home-made spaghetti dish cooked with the basic ingredients of a pizza, such as tomato sauce and olives, but without a pizza crust. The mixture may be cooked in a pot or baked in an oven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recipezaar.com/Pepperoni-Pizzaghetti-24984 Crustless pizza-ghetti in a pot]: recipe from the United States&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recettes.qc.ca/livre/recette.php?id=146994 Baked crustless pizza-ghetti]: recipe from Quebec {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pizza proof without words.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Proof without words]] for 8 sectors by {{harvtxt|Carter|Wagon|1994a}}.]]
In elementary [[geometry]], the '''pizza theorem''' states the equality of two areas that arise when one partitions a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] in a certain way.

Let ''p'' be an interior point of the disk, and let ''n'' be a number that is divisible by four and greater than or equal to eight. Form ''n'' sectors of the disk with equal angles by choosing an arbitrary line through ''p'', rotating the line {{nowrap|{{sfrac|''n''|2}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1}} times by an angle of {{sfrac|2{{pi}}|''n''}} [[radian]]s, and slicing the disk on each of the resulting {{sfrac|''n''|2}} lines. Number the sectors consecutively in a clockwise or anti-clockwise fashion. Then the pizza theorem states that:

:'' The sum of the areas of the odd numbered sectors equals the sum of the areas of the even numbered sectors'' {{harv|Upton|1968}}.

The pizza theorem is so called because it mimics a traditional [[pizza]] slicing technique. It shows that, if two people share a pizza sliced in this way by taking alternating slices, then they each get an equal amount of pizza.

==History==
The pizza theorem was originally proposed as a challenge problem by {{harvtxt|Upton|1968}}. The published solution to this problem, by Michael Goldberg, involved direct manipulation of the algebraic expressions for the areas of the sectors.
{{harvtxt|Carter|Wagon|1994a}} provide an alternative proof by [[Dissection puzzle|dissection]]. They show how to partition the sectors into smaller pieces so that each piece in an odd-numbered sector has a [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] piece in an even-numbered sector, and vice versa. {{harvtxt|Frederickson|2012}} gave a family of dissection proofs for all cases (in which the number of sectors {{nowrap|is 8, 12, 16, ...}}).

==Generalizations==
[[File:Pizza theorem2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|12 sectors: green area = orange area]]
The requirement that the number of sectors be a multiple of four is necessary: as [[Don Coppersmith]] showed, dividing a disk into four sectors, or a number of sectors that is not divisible by four, does not in general produce equal areas. {{harvtxt|Mabry|Deiermann|2009}} answered a problem of {{harvtxt|Carter|Wagon|1994b}} by providing a more precise version of the theorem that determines which of the two sets of sectors has greater area in the cases that the areas are unequal. Specifically, if the number of sectors is 2 (mod 8) and no slice passes through the center of the disk, then the subset of slices containing the center has smaller area than the other subset, while if the number of sectors is 6 (mod 8) and no slice passes through the center, then the subset of slices containing the center has larger area. An odd number of sectors is not possible with straight-line cuts, and a slice through the center causes the two subsets to be equal regardless of the number of sectors.

{{harvtxt|Mabry|Deiermann|2009}} also observe that, when the pizza is divided evenly, then so is its crust (the crust may be interpreted as either the perimeter of the disk or the area between the boundary of the disk and a smaller circle having the same center, with the cut-point lying in the latter's interior), and since the disks bounded by both circles are partitioned evenly so is their difference. However, when the pizza is divided unevenly, the diner who gets the most pizza area actually gets the least crust.

As {{harvtxt|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|1999}} note, an equal division of the pizza also leads to an equal division of its toppings, as long as each topping is distributed in a disk (not necessarily concentric with the whole pizza) that contains the central point ''p'' of the division into sectors.

==Related results==
{{harvtxt|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|1999}} show that a pizza sliced in the same way as the pizza theorem, into a number ''n'' of sectors with equal angles where ''n'' is divisible by four, can also be shared equally among ''n''/4 people. For instance, a pizza divided into 12 sectors can be shared equally by three people as well as by two; however, to accommodate all five of the Hirschhorns, a pizza would need to be divided into 20 sectors.

{{harvtxt|Cibulka|Kynčl|Mészáros|Stolař|2010}} and {{harvtxt|Knauer|Micek|Ueckerdt|2011}} study the [[game theory]] of choosing free slices of pizza in order to guarantee a large share, a problem posed by Dan Brown and [[Peter Winkler]]. In the version of the problem they study, a pizza is sliced radially (without the guarantee of equal-angled sectors) and two diners alternately choose pieces of pizza that are adjacent to an already-eaten sector. If the two diners both try to maximize the amount of pizza they eat, the diner who takes the first slice can guarantee a 4/9 share of the total pizza, and there exists a slicing of the pizza such that he cannot take more. The [[fair division]] or cake cutting problem considers similar games in which different players have different criteria for how they measure the size of their share; for instance, one diner may prefer to get the most pepperoni while another diner may prefer to get the most cheese.

==See also==
Other mathematical results related to pizza slicing involve the [[lazy caterer's sequence]], a sequence of integers that counts the maximum number of pieces of pizza that one can obtain by a given number of straight slices, and the [[ham sandwich theorem]], a result about slicing three-dimensional objects whose two-dimensional version implies that any pizza, no matter how misshapen, can have its area and its crust length simultaneously bisected by a single carefully chosen straight-line cut.

The '''World Pizza Championship''' is an event held annually to determine the world's best [[pizza]] makers. It began in 1991 and is organized by the magazine ''Pizza e Pasta Italiana'' and PizzaNew.  In 2008, over 20 countries competed Pizzas are judged by preparation, taste, bake and presentation. Pizza competitions include those for fastest pizza maker, freestyle acrobatics and the largest dough stretch. Salsomaggiore Terme ([[Parma]]), [[Italy]], is the site of the championships, although several other cities likewise claim to be the home of the ultimate international pizza games including Naples and Paris.

One of the main attractions to the championship is the presence of [[Miss Italia]] (Miss Italy), who crowns the winning pizzaiolos.  It is the worlds largest pizza show in the world with over 6,500 independent chain and franchise owners from all around the world attending. The winners are inducted into the Pizza Hall of Fame and are sometimes invited back to judge the next World Pizza Championship. They also win a cash prize totaling to no more than about $10,000. They have different categories like best Vegetarian Pizza, best Meat pizza, etc. At the end of the competition, the best pizza overall is selected. Whoever wins not only receives the great incentives but also receives free marketing for themselves or for their business. The business or business owner will receive a plaque to be hung and bragging rights that they won the biggest pizza competition in the world. One of the biggest names is Tony Gemignani who has won the championship many times.

'''Pizza''' is a traditional [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] [[Dish (food)|dish]] consisting of a yeasted [[flatbread]] typically topped with [[tomato sauce]] and [[cheese]] and baked in an oven. It can also be topped with additional vegetables, meats, and [[condiments]]. 

The term ''pizza'' was first recorded in the 10th century, in a Latin manuscript from the [[Southern Italy]] town of [[Gaeta]] in [[Lazio]], on the border with Campania.&lt;ref name=MartinMaiden/&gt; Modern pizza was invented in [[Naples]], and the dish and its variants have since become popular and common in many areas of the world.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Hanna|title=American Pie|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/american-pie|publisher=American Heritage Magazine|accessdate=4 May 2012|date=April–May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, upon [[Italy]]'s request, [[Neapolitan pizza]] was registered with the [[European Union]] as a [[Traditional Speciality Guaranteed]] dish.&lt;ref&gt;Official Journal of the European Union, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:034:0007:0016:EN:PDF Commission regulation (EU) No 97/2010], 5 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Trademark Association, [http://www.inta.org/INTABulletin/Pages/EUROPEANUNIONPIZZANAPOLETANAObtainsTraditionalSpecialityGuaranteedStatus.aspx European Union: Pizza napoletana obtains &quot;Traditional Speciality Guaranteed&quot; status], 1 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana'' (True Neapolitan Pizza Association), a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples, aims to &quot;promote and protect... the true Neapolitan pizza&quot;.&lt;ref name=AVPN&gt;{{cite web|title=Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN)|url=http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/eng_chisiamo.php|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizza is one of the most popular foods in the world and common [[fast food]] item in Europe and North America. Many independent or chain restaurants, cafes, and fast food outlets offer pizza. Restaurants or chains specializing in pizza are [[pizzeria]]s. [[Pizza delivery]] is common in some parts of the world.

Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, either whole or in portions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baofu 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Baofu | first=P. | title=The Future of Post-Human Culinary Art: Towards a New Theory of Ingredients and Techniques | publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publisher | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-4438-4484-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7QwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA281 | page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various types of ovens are used to cook them and many varieties exist. Several similar dishes are prepared from ingredients commonly used in pizza preparation, such as [[calzone]] and [[Stromboli (food)|stromboli]]. In the United States, pizza is usually [[finger food|eaten out of hand]] after dividing into slices from a large pizza or small [[pizzetta]] as a whole. In Italy, pizza is eaten with a fork and knife in restaurants, but is also sold to take away and eaten out of hand. [[Frozen food|Frozen]] pizza became popular in the late 20th century.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pizza&quot; ({{IPA-it|ˈpittsa|lang}}) first appeared in a Latin text from the [[southern Italy]] town of [[Gaeta]], then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta ''duodecim pizze'' (&quot;twelve pizzas&quot;) every [[Christmas|Christmas Day]], and another twelve every [[Easter Sunday]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=MartinMaiden&gt;{{cite web |first=Martin |last=Maiden |website=yourDictionary.com |title=Linguistic Wonders Series: Pizza is a German(ic) Word |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/pizza.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030115224054/http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/pizza.html |archivedate=2003-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Salvatore Riciniello (1987) ''Codice Diplomatico Gaetano'', Vol. I, La Poligrafica&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggested etymologies include:
*  [[Byzantine Greek]] and [[Late Latin]] ''pitta'' &gt; ''pizza,'' ''cf.'' Modern Greek [[pita|pitta]] bread and the Apulia and Calabrian (then [[Catepanate of Italy|Byzantine Italy]]) ''pitta,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Babiniotis |first=Georgios |date=2005 |title=Λεξικό της Νέας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας |trans-title=[[Dictionary of Modern Greek]] |language=el |publisher=Lexicology Centre |isbn=960-86190-1-7 |page=1413}}&lt;/ref&gt; a round flat bread baked in the oven at high temperature sometimes with toppings. The word ''pitta'' can in turn be traced to either [[Ancient Greek]] πικτή (''pikte''), &quot;fermented pastry&quot;, which in Latin became &quot;picta&quot;, or Ancient Greek πίσσα (''pissa'', [[Attic dialect|Attic]] πίττα, ''pitta''), &quot;pitch&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pizza |title=''Pizza'', at Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2383267 |title=''Pissa'', Liddell and Scott, &quot;A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''pḗtea'', &quot;bran&quot; (''pētítēs'', &quot;bran bread&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=pizza&amp;r=66 |title=''Pizza'', at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foods similar to pizza have been made since the [[neolithic age]]. Records of people adding other ingredients to [[bread]] to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] supplemented their bread with [[vegetable oil|oils]], herbs, and cheese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Talati-Padiyar|first1=Dhwani|title=Travelled, Tasted, Tried &amp; Tailored: Food Chronicles|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c0wiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67|isbn=1304961354|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Buonassisi, Rosario|title=Pizza: From its Italian Origins to the Modern Table|year=2000|publisher=Firefly|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 6th century BC, the soldiers in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] King [[Darius I]]'s armies baked flatbreads with cheese and [[date (fruit)|date]]s on top of their battle shields.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Pizza, A Slice of American History&quot; Liz Barrett (2014), p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Science of Bakery Products&quot; W. P. Edwards (2007), p.199&lt;/ref&gt; An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the [[Aeneid]], when Celaeno, queen of the [[Harpies]], foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, [[Aeneas]] and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables.

Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in [[Naples, Italy|Naples]] in the 18th or early 19th century.&lt;ref name=Helstosky21&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helstosky|first1=Carol|title=Pizza: A Global History|date=2008|publisher=Reaktion|location=London|isbn=1-86189-391-4|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Prior to that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, cheese, and basil. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims.&lt;ref name=Helstosky21 /&gt; Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries, and pizzerias keep this old tradition alive today. 

A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, ''[[pizza Margherita]]'', was invented in 1889, when the [[Palace of Capodimonte|Royal Palace of Capodimonte]] commissioned the Neapolitan [[wikt:pizzaiolo|pizzaiolo]] (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting [[Margherita of Savoy|Queen Margherita]]. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pizza Margherita: History and Recipe | url = http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy-featured/recipes/pizza-margherita-history-and-recipe | work = Italy Magazine | date = 14 March 2011 | accessdate = 23 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although recent research casts doubt on this legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Was margherita pizza really named after Italy's queen? | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/0/20515123 | work = BBC Food | date = 28 December 2012 | accessdate = 31 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizza was brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helstosky|first1=Carol|title=Pizza: A Global History|date=2008|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-630-8|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants concentrated.

==Preparation==
[[File:USMC-03074.jpg|thumb|Eating of pizza]]
Pizza is prepared fresh, [[Frozen food|frozen]], and as portion-size slices or pieces. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.

Another form of uncooked pizza is available from [[take and bake pizzeria]]s. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold to customers to bake in their own [[Conventional ovens|ovens]]. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to complete at home before baking in an oven.

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Cooking===
In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a [[conveyor belt]] oven or, in the case of more expensive restaurants, a wood- or coal-fired [[masonry oven|brick oven]]. On deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a [[peel (tool)|peel]], and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum). Prior to use, a peel may be sprinkled with cornmeal to allow pizza to easily slide onto and off of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmI2YJ1vMxMC&amp;pg=PA3 | title=Make Great Pizza at Home | publisher=Taste of America Press | author=Owens, Martin J. | year=2003 | pages=3 | isbn=0-9744470-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When made at home, it can be baked on a [[pizza stone]] in a regular oven to reproduce the effect of a brick oven. Another option is [[grilled pizza]], in which the crust is baked directly on a barbecue grill. [[Greek pizza]], like Chicago-style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.

When it comes to preparation, the dough and ingredients can be combined on any kind of table. With [[mass production]] of pizzas the process can be completely automated. Most restaurants still use standard and purpose built pizza preparation tables. Pizzerias nowadays can even opt for hi tech pizza preparation tables that combine mass production elements with traditional techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automated pizza preparation table|url=http://rotopizza.club/|publisher=rotopizza.club|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crust===
[[File:Hot pizza.jpg|thumb|A pizza just removed from an oven, with a close-up view of the ''cornicione'' (the outer edge)]]

The bottom of the pizza, called the &quot;crust&quot;, may vary widely according to style—thin as in a typical hand-tossed [[Neapolitan pizza]], or thick as in a deep-dish [[Chicago-style pizza|Chicago-style]]. It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the ''cornicione''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braimbridge|first1=Sophie |last2=Glynn|first2=Joanne |title=Food of Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXUkqkBA-DkC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2005|publisher=Murdoch Books|isbn=978-1-74045-464-3|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often pizza dough contains sugar, both to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeAngelis|first=Dominick A.|title=The Art of Pizza Making: Trade Secrets and Recipes|date=December 1, 2011|publisher=The Creative Pizza Company|isbn=0-9632034-0-1|pages=20–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less expensive [[processed cheese]]s or [[cheese analogue]]s have been developed for [[mass-market]] pizzas to produce desirable qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and stable [[shelf life]]. This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of [[vegetable oil]], manufacturing and culture processes, [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] whey proteins and other changes in manufacture. In 1997 it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was {{convert|1|e6t|short ton|abbr=off}} in the U.S. and {{convert|100000|t|short ton|abbr=off}} in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Cheese Science |last=Fox |first=Patrick F.; () |year=2000 |publisher=Aspen Pub |location= |isbn=0-8342-1260-9 |page=482 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oRp5VCVTQQC&amp;pg=PA482&amp;dq=pizza+cheese |accessdate= |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common toppings for pizza in the United States include ground beef, mushrooms, onions, [[pepperoni]], pineapple, garlic, olives, peppers, carrots, tomatoes, spinach, anchovies, chicken, bacon, ham and sausage. Distinct regional types developed in the twentieth century, including [[California-style pizza|California]], [[Chicago-style pizza|Chicago]], [[Greek pizza|Greek]], [[New Haven-style pizza|New Haven]], [[Detroit-style pizza|Detroit]], [[St. Louis-style pizza|St. Louis]], and [[New York-style pizza|New York]] styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuip.uchicago.edu&quot;/&gt; The first pizzeria in the U.S. was opened in New York's Little Italy in 1905&lt;ref name=&quot;LonelyPlanet&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=New York City 7 |last=Otis |first=Ginger Adams |year=2010 |publisher=Lonely Planet |location= |isbn=1741795915 |page=256 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=btN9Lh8v3OQC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=New+York-style+pizza&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mLG3UMq2LonVigKogoHADg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20York-style%20pizza&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then regions throughout the U.S. offer variations, including deep-dish, stuffed, pockets, turnovers, [[Pizza Rolls|rolled]] and pizza-on-a-stick, each with seemingly limitless combinations of sauce and toppings.

Another variation is grilled pizza, created by taking a fairly thin, round (more typically, irregularly shaped) sheet of yeasted pizza dough, placing it directly over the fire of a grill and then turning it over once the bottom has baked and placing a thin layer of toppings on the baked side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What Can I Bring?

'''Pizza delivery''' is a service in which a [[pizzeria]] or pizza chain [[Delivery (commerce)|delivers]] a [[pizza]] to a customer. An order is typically made either by telephone or over the internet to the pizza chain, in which the customer can request pizza type, size and other products alongside the pizza, commonly including soft drinks. Pizzas may be delivered in pizza boxes or delivery bags, and deliveries are made with either an automobile, [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motorized scooter]], or [[bicycle]]. Customers can, depending on the pizza chain, choose to pay online, or in person, with cash, credit or a debit card. A delivery fee is often charged with what the customer has bought.

==Ordering==
Ordering pizza for delivery usually involves contacting a local pizza restaurant or chain by telephone or online. Online ordering is available in many countries, where some pizza chains offer online menus and ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kretzmann |first=David |url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/2013/12/10/why-dominos-digital-component-is-important/?source=edddlftxt0860001 |title=Why Domino's Digital Component Is Important |publisher=DailyFinance |date= |accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pizza delivery industry has kept pace with technological developments since the 1980s beginning with the rise of the personal computer. Specialized computer software for the pizza delivery business helps determine the most efficient routes for carriers, track exact order and delivery times, manage calls and orders with [[Point of Sale|PoS]] software, and other functions. Since 2008 [[GPS]] tracking technology has been used for real-time monitoring of delivery vehicles by customers over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Kolbasuk McGee. [http://www.informationweek.com/news/206102079 &quot;GPS Comes To High-Tech Pizza-Delivery Tracking&quot;], ''[[InformationWeek]]'', Feb 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pizzerias, such as the [[Ontario]]-based [[Canada|Canadian]] chain [[Pizza Pizza]], will incorporate a guarantee to deliver within a predetermined period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pizzapizza.ca/guarantee.htm|title= Pizza Pizza's Guarantee|format= Commercial website|publisher= pizzapizza.ca|accessdate= 2007-12-07|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071224054617/http://www.pizzapizza.ca/guarantee.htm|archivedate= 2007-12-24|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Domino's Pizza]] had a commercial campaign in the 1980s and early 1990s which guaranteed orders in 30 minutes. The guarantee was for 3 dollars off the order if broken but is often misremembered today as &quot;30 minutes or its free&quot;. This was discontinued in the United States in 1993 due to the number of lawsuits arising from accidents caused by hurried delivery drivers, but is still offered in some countries. Pizzerias with no time guarantee will commonly state to the customer an approximate time frame for a delivery, without making any guarantees as to the actual delivery time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

According to Domino's, [[Super Bowl Sunday]] is the most popular day for its pizza deliveries; others are [[Halloween]], [[New Year's Day]], [[New Year's Eve]], and the day before [[Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dominos19990126&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dominos-pizza-readies-for-record-sales-on-super-bowl-sunday-73513857.html | title=Domino's Pizza Readies for Record Sales on Super Bowl Sunday | publisher=PR Newswire | date=1999-01-26 | accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unscheduled events may also cause an increase in pizza deliveries; for example, Domino's stated that its sales during the O. J. Simpson [[slow-speed chase]] were as large as on Super Bowl Sunday.&lt;ref name=&quot;dp19960122&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-oj-simpson-boosted-dominos-sales-2014-6 | title=How O.J.

For decades, &quot;free delivery&quot; was a popular slogan for almost all pizza stores.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= 2007-05-13|url= http://agreatpizza.com/history-free-pizza-delivery/|title= How Pizzas got Delivered for free?|publisher= Agreatpizza.com|format = website|accessdate= 2007-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, a portion of the delivery charge is given to the driver as the store is required to reimburse the driver for the use of a personal vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Pizza box===
{{Main|Pizza box}}
[[File:Pizza Funghi mit Pizzahalter.JPG|thumb|Pizza in a box, with a [[pizza saver]] in the middle]]

Modern pizza boxes are made of [[corrugated fiberboard]].&lt;ref name=madrigal&gt;{{Cite news |first=Alexis |last=Madrigal |author-link=Alexis Madrigal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/07/the-3-big-advances-in-the-technology-of-the-pizza-box/242116/ |title=The 3 Big Advances in the Technology of the Pizza Box |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=July 18, 2011 |access-date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrugated board has a number of advantages for pizza delivery: it is cheap, recyclable, and disposable, it is stiff yet light, it is absorbent thus keeping oil and juice from leaking, and the channels of air in the cardboard have excellent insulation properties.&lt;ref name=petroski&gt;{{Cite news |first=Henry |last=Petroski |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/4/a-round-pie-in-a-square-box/1 |title=A Round Pie in a Square Box |work=[[American Scientist]] |date=July–August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the pizza box began in Naples during the 1800s where bakers put pizzas into metal containers called [[stufa]]s: round, vented tin or copper containers with shelves that held the pizzas apart from one another.&lt;ref name=madrigal/&gt; Since the 1940s pizza take-out was done with the pizza sitting on a round cardboard base and covered with a paper bag.&lt;ref name=madrigal/&gt; It is believed Domino's developed the modern corrugated flat square pizza box in the early 1960s, but they never patented it.&lt;ref name=madrigal/&gt; Patent designs for pizza boxes date to at least 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=ZPp0AAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=3484015|title = US Patent 3484015|publisher = Google Patent Search }}&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations since have included various venting configurations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chari |first=Mridula |title=This is the world's best-designed pizza box |url=http://qz.com/170463/this-is-the-worlds-best-designed-pizza-box/ |publisher=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  built-in holders for extra sauces; designs for easier recycling; and perforated tops so wedge-shaped pieces of cardboard can be used as plates.&lt;ref name=madrigal/&gt;&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt;  The lid of the box is often supported by a disposable plastic tripod on top of the pizza known as a [[pizza saver]].

Pizza boxes have a large amount of corrugated fiberboard, individually and in total volume produced each year, but they are not accepted by some municipal [[recycling]] programs because the cardboard is often soaked with grease, making them unsuitable for some forms of recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Granger|first= Trey|url= http://earth911.com/news/2009/02/18/is-food-packaging-really-recyclable/|title= Is Food Packaging Really Recyclable?| publisher= earth911.com|accessdate= 22 January 2013|date=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boxes may thus be commonly thrown away with household [[waste]] into landfills; a more environmentally friendly disposal option that has been proposed is a form of [[compost]]ing for pizza boxes. It is also possible to tear off unstained or unsaturated sections such as the lid and/or sides of the box and recycle those.

===Pizza saver===
{{main|Pizza saver}}

In 1985 Carmela Vitale was issued a patent for a plastic 3-legged tripod stool that would sit in the middle of the box and keep the top from sagging into the pie.&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt; Vitale called her device a &quot;package saver&quot; and used that term also as the title of her patent, but it has since been renamed the &quot;[[pizza saver]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt; Variations on the device have since been invented, such as a disposable plastic spatula whose handle holds the box top up; and a plastic tripod like that made by Vitalie, but with one of the legs serrated like a knife, making for easy cutting of stuck cheese and bread.&lt;ref name=petroski/&gt;

==Employment==
[[File:Pizza Delivery in a College Town Open Late.jpg|alt=|thumb|This pizzeria bills itself as being open late.]]
{{unbalanced|section|date=December 2012}}
In the [[United States]], two labor unions have been formed specifically for pizza delivery drivers: the now-defunct [[Association of Pizza Delivery Drivers]] (APDD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Associated Press|date = 2004-11-18|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6519923/|title = Pizza drivers seek national union|publisher = MSNBC.com|accessdate= 2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Union of Pizza Delivery Drivers]] (AUPDD).&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday092206&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author = Associated Press| date = 2006-09-22|url = https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2006-09-22-pizza-union_x.htm?csp=34|title = Pizza delivery drivers form first union|publisher = ''USA Today'' via usatoday.com|accessdate = 2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

APDD was formed in 2002. Its initial claim to fame was as an Internet-based union, eschewing traditional methods of organizing, and making contributions and the sale of goods the center of its fundraising activities, instead of dues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} People could join APDD using a form at their website, or chat with its officers in an [[IRC]]-compatible [[Java (programming language)|Java]] chat every Tuesday evening. At its peak, it claimed approximately 1,000 members in 46 US states.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} APDD held several certification votes in the US, but was never successful in organizing a local. In March 2006 APDD lost a lawsuit against a Domino's franchise in Mansfield, Ohio. This combined with massive debt left the union with little choice but to shut down.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

AUPDD was founded in early 2006 by Jim Pohle, a driver for a [[Domino's Pizza]] store in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday092206&quot; /&gt; It was certified as the representative union for his store in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aupdd.org/PhotoAlbum.asp |title=Photo Album |format=Organization website |publisher=American Union of Pizza Delivery Drivers |accessdate=2007-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929072257/http://www.aupdd.org/PhotoAlbum.asp |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pohle cites the sub-[[List of U.S. state minimum wages|minimum wage]] paid by his store as the instigating factor in forming a union.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday092206&quot; /&gt;

While formed in the more traditional method of organizing at one's own workplace, AUPDD uses certain Internet-based techniques originated by APDD, such as its mass communications with the press and its fundraising activities (although more traditional dues are collected from the eleven members of the fledgling local).{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} It also uses the Internet as its primary outreach to those wishing to start locals across the US.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Hazards==
[[File:2009-03-20 Papa John's Pizza out for delivery in Durham.jpg|thumb|[[Papa John's Pizza]] delivery]]

Pizza delivery, by its nature, can pose risks for those engaged in it, as they are required to go to the homes of strangers, in unfamiliar neighborhoods. 

In 2004, Pizza Hut fired a delivery driver who shot and killed a robber while on the job, citing its company policy against employees carrying weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 2004-05-18|url =http://www.theindychannel.com/news/3320630/detail.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031093057/http://www.theindychannel.com/news/3320630/detail.html |archivedate=31 October 2004 |title = Deliveryman: I Shot Man In Self-Defense|publisher = The Indy Channel (television news website)|accessdate =1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other national chains such as Domino's and Papa John's also prohibit carrying weapons, though many independent pizzerias allow delivery persons to carry weapons in a legal manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;chan1996&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date = July 16, 2004|url = http://ohioccw.org/200407182215/indiana-arming-delivery-drivers-a-tossup-for-pizzerias.html|title = Arming delivery drivers a tossup for pizzerias|publisher =''Indianapolis Star'' via ohioccw.org (commercial website)|accessdate = 2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employer restrictions on carrying weapons is a controversial issue in the U.S.

===Prank order===
Pizza places may be subject to prank orders for numerous pizzas or to random houses or a target house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't believe your eyes... Pizza delivery men tricked by pranksters ordering food to fake houses|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210778/Dont-believe-eyes--Pizza-delivery-men-tricked-pranksters-ordering-food-fake-houses.html|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prank order may cost businesses money and aggravation, resulting in the restaurant throwing away the unpaid pizzas. For example, in November 2010 in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], a man claiming to be part of [[Bob Dylan]]'s crew placed an order for 148 pizzas which cost nearly $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruno |first=Jackie |title=Amherst police called after pizza prank |url=http://www.wwlp.com/dpp/news/local/hampshire/Amherst-police-called-after-pizza-prank |publisher=WWLP-22News |accessdate=25 October 2012 |date=23 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111235101/http://www.wwlp.com/dpp/news/local/hampshire/Amherst-police-called-after-pizza-prank |archivedate=January 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prank callers have been fined in Singapore for placing false orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Airlines pilot accused of prank fast-food calls |url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=1255b494-dfdf-4af5-99d8-8e6ef00c02a9 |publisher=Canada.com |accessdate=25 October 2012 |date=14 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517212005/http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=1255b494-dfdf-4af5-99d8-8e6ef00c02a9 |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assaults on pizza delivery workers===

Pizza delivery drivers have been subjected to assault, kidnappings, robbery, and have sometimes been raped or killed on the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;chan1996&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Chan|first= Sewell|date =1996-07-10|url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB836951715273632000?mod=googlewsj|title = Pizza Redlining: Green Says 'Go', Red Says Tough Neighborhood|work=The Wall Street Journal Online|accessdate = 2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |agency=Associated Press |date=2004-01-05 |url=http://www.news4jax.com/news/2742092/detail.html |title=Police: Teens Rape, Rob Tallahassee Pizza Delivery Woman |publisher=News4Jax.com |accessdate=2007-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022051756/http://www.news4jax.com/news/2742092/detail.html |archivedate=2007-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fake orders are sometimes used to lure robbery victims or kidnappings, and delivery people have been injured and killed in robberies and kidnappings.&lt;ref name=&quot;wlwt1&quot;&gt;[http://www.wlwt.com/news/21241546/detail.html Pizza Chains Create 'Do Not Deliver' List - Some Areas Deemed Too Unsafe For Pizza Deliveries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929161814/http://www.wlwt.com/news/21241546/detail.html |date=2011-09-29 }}, WLWT, Cincinnati News, October 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2007/07/23/swick.html Two teens charged with murder of pizza delivery driver], ''The Columbus Dispatch'', July 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pizza delivery workers who have been lured and murdered include [[Murder of Yafim Weinstein|Yafim Weinstein]], [[Death of Brian Douglas Wells|Brian Douglas Wells]], and [[Bailey Junior Kurariki|Michael Choy]].

==In popular culture==
[[File:World-wide delivery in 30 minutes or less.JPG|thumb|right|[[Minuteman Missile National Historic Site]] entrance door]]

Pizza delivery has been featured as a major element in several media in popular culture. There are several works of fiction where the main character delivers pizzas, including [[Tom Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[I Am Charlotte Simmons]]'' (2004), and [[Neal Stephenson]]'s [[cyberpunk]] novel ''[[Snow Crash]]'' (1992), which posits a future in which pizza delivery is organised by the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] as one of the US's four major industries. Several feature films also use pizza delivery prominently, including the 1984 comedy ''[[Delivery Boys]]'', the [[Spike Lee]] [[1989 in film|1989]] film ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', and the 2000 [[comedy]] film ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]''. In the case of other films, use of pizza delivery has been regarded by critics as &quot;overly integrated [[product placement]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;boerner&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author = Heather Boerner|url = http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/R-L-Stines-Haunting.html|title = Review of ''R.L. Stine's Haunting House: Don't Think About'': Tween-friendly, ad-happy Halloween fright fest|publisher = Common Sense Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizza delivery has been the subject of films, even to the point of being the subject of such feature-length films as ''[[Drivers Wanted]]'' and ''[[Fat Pizza: The Movie]]'', as well as ''Pizza: The Movie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Joshua Tyler|url = http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Pizza-The-Movie-583.html|title = ''Pizza: The Movie'' - Review|date = 2004-07-25 |work=Cinema Blend}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pizza delivery has served as major plot element of such films as ''[[Loverboy (1989 film)|Loverboy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Caryn James|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D8123AF93AA15757C0A96F948260|title = Reviews/Film; A Youth's Salty Specialty On a Pizza-Delivery Route|work=The New York Times|date = April 29, 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 American comedy film ''[[30 Minutes or Less]]'' is concerned about the kidnapping of a pizza-delivery driver and his subsequent coercive involvement in a [[bank robbery]], which was loosely based on the 2003 death of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] pizza deliveryman [[Death of Brian Douglas Wells|Brian Douglas Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;The Tennessean August 11, 2011 Section D&lt;/ref&gt; In television, the Australian comedy series ''[[Pizza (TV series)|Pizza]]'' centres on Pauly and his co-workers who deliver pizzas for a Sydney-based pizzeria called Fat Pizza.

{{unreferenced|date=March 2017}}
A '''pizza farm''' is an educational visitor attraction consisting of a small [[farm]] on a circular piece of land partitioned into plots shaped like [[pizza]] wedges. 
The farm's segments produce ingredients that can be used in pizza, such as [[wheat]] for the crust, [[tomato]]es or [[herb]]s, [[pork]] for [[pepperoni]], [[Dairy cattle|dairy cows]] for [[cheese]], and even trees for pizza oven [[firewood]].  Certain farms may even have access to coal or natural gas deposits that can be used as additional pizza oven heating fuels.  Many of the newer pizza farms are experimenting with [[alternative energy]], such as installing [[wind turbines]] in the fields, to be more green. According to a 2005 article in USA Today, there are several such farms in the United States.

The dough is usually a bread dough thicker than that of the classic [[pizza Margherita]], and the traditional topping consists of usually caramelised (almost pureed) [[onion]]s, [[black olive]]s, and [[Anchovy|anchovies]] (whole, and sometimes also with ''[[pissalat]]'', a type of anchovy paste).&lt;ref name=child&gt;Julia Child (1961) ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking'' Vol. 1, Alfred A.

The etymology of the word seems to be from the Latin ''piscis'',&lt;ref name=EDMF&gt;{{cite book | last =David | first = Elizabeth| authorlink = | coauthors = | title =A Book of Mediterranean Food | publisher = Grub Street| year = 1999| location = London| pages =38/39 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-902304-27-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn became ''pissalat'' (via ''peis salat'', &quot;salted fish&quot; in [[Ligurian (ancient language)|Ligurian]] and [[Niçard]]).&lt;ref&gt;Benvenuto, Alex.

'''Pizza cheese''' encompasses several varieties and types of [[cheese]]s and [[dairy product]]s that are designed and manufactured for use specifically on [[pizza]]. These include [[processed cheese|processed]] and modified cheese such as [[mozzarella]]-like processed cheeses and mozzarella variants. The term can also refer to any type of cheese suitable for use on pizza.&lt;ref name=johncorrell/&gt; The most popular cheeses used in the preparation of pizza are mozzarella (accounting for about 30%), [[provolone]], [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]] and [[Parmesan]]. [[Emmental cheese|Emmental]], [[Pecorino Romano|Romano]] and [[ricotta]] are often used as toppings, and processed pizza cheeses manufactured specifically for pizza are [[mass production|mass-produced]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IrishTimes 2014&quot;/&gt; Some mass-produced pizza cheeses are frozen after manufacturing and shipped frozen.

Processed pizza cheese is manufactured to produce optimal qualities in [[Browning (food process)|browning]], [[melting]], stretchiness and [[fat]] and moisture content. Several studies and experiments have analyzed the impact of [[vegetable oil]], manufacturing and culture processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.danisco.com/about-dupont/news/news-archive/2012/dupont-hurdles-the-process-challenges-for-pizza-cheese/ | title=DuPont Nutrition &amp; Health Hurdles the Process Challenges for Pizza Cheese | publisher=DuPont Nutrition &amp; Health |work=Danisco.com | date=April 3, 2012 | accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; denatured [[whey protein]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AJDT-2001&quot;/&gt; and other changes to create ideal and economical pizza cheeses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guinee 2000&quot;/&gt; In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese products was 2 billion pounds in the United States and 200 million pounds in Europe, and in 2000 demand for the product in Europe was increasing by 8% per year. The trend of steadily-increasing production and consumption of mozzarella and pizza cheese continued into the first decade of the 21st century in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kindstedt 2012&quot;/&gt;

Pizza cheese frequently consists of a blend of two or more cheeses, such as low-moisture Mozzarella or Provolone.&lt;ref name=johncorrell /&gt; Low-moisture Mozzarella was first manufactured in dairy factories in the Midwestern United States, and was originally called &quot;pizza cheese&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CST 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Pizza cheese?

Globally, Mozzarella is the most popular pizza cheese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard 2014&quot;/&gt; However, it has been estimated that in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes2007&quot;/&gt; [[Provolone]] is the second most popular one.&lt;ref name=johncorrell /&gt; [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness.&lt;ref name=johncorrell /&gt; Grated [[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmesan]] may be added to the top of a pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked.&lt;ref name=johncorrell /&gt; A diverse variety of [[processed cheese|processed]] pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. [[Provel]] is one example. Other pizza cheeses include [[Emmental cheese|Emmental]], [[Pecorino Romano|Romano]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bittman 2010&quot;/&gt; and [[Ricotta]] for [[calzone]]s or as a topping.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraioli 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler Fertig 2014&quot;/&gt;

Several cheeses may be mixed together in its formulation, and each has individual browning and blistering characteristics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard 2014&quot;/&gt; For example, a combination of Mozzarella and Cheddar may blister less when cooked compared to other combinations, because cheddar has less elasticity, while Mozzarella and provolone may brown less compared to other combinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard 2014&quot;/&gt;

==Overview==
Due to the [[thermal mass]] of baking stones and the material's property as a poor heat conductor, food is less likely to burn when using a baking stone than when using metal or glass bakeware. Baking stones are a variation on hot stone cooking which is one of the oldest cooking techniques known. Some cooks recommend sprinkling [[corn meal]] or flour on the baking stone to prevent the crust from sticking, or using [[parchment paper]] atop the stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan 2011 p. 263&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Jordan | first=M. | title=California Home Cooking: 400 Recipes that Celebrate the Abundance of Farm and Garden, Orchard and Vineyard, Land and Sea | publisher=Harvard Common Press | series=America cooks | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-55832-119-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NDuMDMLKtHMC&amp;pg=PA263 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks 2006 p. 13&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Brooks | first=M. | title=The Guaranteed No Burnt Bottoms Cookies Cookbook | publisher=Monica's Best Bakes | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-615-13418-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGkzCNdhLGoC&amp;pg=PA13 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reinhart Manville 2011 p. 260&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Reinhart | first=P. | last2=Manville | first2=R. | title=The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread | publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony | series=The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-60774-129-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htveL1MPqYMC&amp;pg=PA260 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Black 2016 p. 158&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Black | first=S. | title=One Dough, Ten Breads: Making Great Bread by Hand | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year=2016 | isbn=978-0-544-57933-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2cGCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baking &quot;stones&quot; may be purchased as unglazed ceramic tiles, unglazed fired clay tiles and quarried tiles, from tile shops and hardware stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler Stratton 2005 p. 27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reinhart Manville 2007 p. 85&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Reinhart | first=P. | last2=Manville | first2=R. | title=Peter Reinhart's Whole Grain Breads: New Techniques, Extraordinary Flavor | publisher=Ten Speed Press | series=Cookery, Food and Drink Series | year=2007 | isbn=978-1-58008-759-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJrYTmaI0UsC&amp;pg=PA85 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alterman Nauman 2015 p. 90&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Alterman | first=T. | last2=Nauman | first2=T. | title=Whole Grain Baking Made Easy: Craft Delicious, Healthful Breads, Pastries, Desserts, and More - Including a Comprehensive Guide to Grinding Grains | publisher=Voyageur Press | year=2015 | isbn=978-0-7603-4598-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2o-1CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 | access-date=October 12, 2017 | page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pizza stone==
When designed for cooking [[pizza]]s, a baking stone is often referred to as a pizza stone. Using a pizza stone more or less mimicks the effects of cooking a pizza in a [[masonry oven]]. The [[porous]] nature of the stone used also helps absorb moisture, resulting in a crispy crust. Small pizza stones can be purchased to fit in any conventional cooking [[oven]] or an enclosed [[barbecue grill|barbecue-style grill]]. High-end ovens sometimes offer optional pizza stones that are specifically designed for each oven model and may include a specialized [[heating element]].  In addition to traditional methods, a Pizza stone can also be made out of metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Parsons, Russ | title=A pizza stone of steel | website=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 1, 2013 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/01/news/la-dd-a-pizza-stone-of-steel-20130131 | access-date=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Perry, Charles | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/22/food/fo-soapstone22 |title=Soapstone: cookware that rocks |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=February 22, 2006 |accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Pizza Underground''' was an American [[Comedy music|comedy]] [[Rock music|rock]] band based in [[New York City]]. Mainly [[Parody music|parodying]] songs by [[the Velvet Underground]] with [[pizza]]-themed song names and lyrics, the group consisted of former [[child actor]] [[Macaulay Culkin]] ([[kazoo]], [[percussion]] and vocals) along with Matt Colbourn (guitar, vocals), [[Phoebe Kreutz]] ([[glockenspiel]], vocals), Deenah Vollmer ([[pizza box]], vocals) and Austin Kilham ([[tambourine]], vocals).&lt;ref name=pitchfork&gt;{{cite web|last=Pelly|first=Jenn|title=Listen: Macaulay Culkin Has a Pizza-Themed Velvet Underground Cover Band, The Pizza Underground|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/53269-listen-macaulay-culkin-has-a-pizza-themed-velvet-underground-cover-band-the-pizza-underground/|work=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jezebel&gt;{{cite web|last=Beck|first=Laura|title=Macaulay Culkin Has a Pizza-Themed Velvet Underground Cover Band|url=http://jezebel.com/macaulay-culkin-has-a-pizza-themed-velvet-underground-c-1479308740|work=[[Jezebel]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rollingstone&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayers|first=Mike|title=Inside Macaulay Culkin's Pizza Underground Sessions|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/inside-macaulay-culkins-pizza-underground-sessions-20131212|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the theme, the band gave out boxed pizzas to people who attended their live performances.

==History==

Deenah Vollmer, the group's &quot;pizza box&quot; percussionist, said the idea for the Pizza Underground began as a joke in 2012.&lt;ref name=philly&gt;{{cite web|last=Amorosi|first=A.D.|title=Season of tributes to Lou Reed - including Macaulay Culkin's band Pizza Underground Read|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/music/20140123_Macaulay_Culkin_s_Pizza_Underground_brings_Velvet_tribute_to_PhilaMOCA.html|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=philly.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We soon realized you can replace most any word with slice or cheese,&quot; she told ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. [[Glockenspiel]] player Phoebe Kreutz stated they believed the Velvet Underground songs were written about pizza, but had to be reworded to accommodate the &quot;standards of their day.&quot;&lt;ref name=philly /&gt;

On November 11, 2013, the group recorded a live demo at [[Macaulay Culkin]]'s house.&lt;ref name=pitchfork /&gt; That same month they performed a [[Lou Reed]] tribute show at the Sidewalk Cafe in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|last=Michaels|first=Sean|title=Macaulay Culkin forms pizza-themed Velvet Underground tribute band|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/09/macaulay-culkin-pizza-velvet-underground|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, a viral video of Culkin eating a cheese pizza was uploaded to [[YouTube]]. He was parodying [[Andy Warhol]] consuming a [[Burger King Whopper]] in [[Jørgen Leth]]'s documentary ''66 Scenes from America''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pzm1lQX0qU&lt;/ref&gt; Culkin was promoting the debut of the Pizza Underground.&lt;ref&gt;Luling, Todd Van, December 27, 2013 [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/27/pizza-news-2013_n_4462102.html 'The 34 greatest moments in pizza history from 2013'], retrieved December 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The group released its first music video in January 2014, parodying various Velvet Underground songs such as &quot;All Pizza Parties&quot; (&quot;[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]&quot;), &quot;Pizza Gal&quot; (&quot;[[Femme Fatale (The Velvet Underground song)|Femme Fatale]]&quot;) and &quot;Take a Bite of the Wild Slice&quot; ([[Lou Reed]]'s &quot;[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=huffpost&gt;{{cite web|last=Kristobak|first=Ryan|title=Macaulay Culkin Band Pizza Underground's First Music Video Is Full Of Pizza Faces|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/07/macaulay-culkin-pizza-band-video_n_4556771.html|work=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video featured the group performing on a bed of pizza boxes, surrounded by pizza checkered walls, with members of the group wearing slices of pizza as masks.&lt;ref name=daily_news&gt;{{cite web|last=Eby|first=Margaret|title=Macaulay Culkin's Pizza Underground band debuts saucy music video|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/macauley-culkin-pizza-underground-band-debuts-video-article-1.1569761|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2014, the cassette of the demo was released by Bitter Melody Records&lt;ref&gt;Bitter Melody Records, [http://bittermelodyrecords.limitedrun.com/about About Bitter Melody Records].

'''National pizza month''' is an American observance that occurs for the month of October every year.

==History==
This observance began in October 1984, and was created by Gerry Durnell, the publisher of ''[[Pizza Today]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPM&quot;/&gt; Some people observe National pizza month by consuming various types of [[pizza]]s or pizza slices, or going to various pizzerias.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genovese&quot;/&gt; During the month, some [[pizzerias]] give away free pizzas or pizza slices to customers or offer reduced-price promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmq.com/October-2014/Pie-Five-Pies-It-Forward-For-National-Pizza-Month/|title=Pie Five Pizza pays it forward|publisher=PMQ Pizza Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/26685710/pizza-restaurant-gives-away-free-pies-in-honor-of-national-pizza-month|title=Pizza restaurant gives away free pies in honor of National Pizza|date=2 October 2014|publisher=DC News FOX 5|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/story/23598725/happys-pizza-celebrating-national-pizza-month|title=Happy's Pizza celebrating National Pizza Month|date=3 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmq.com/September-2014/Dominos-Pizza-to-Offer-Weeklong-Carryout-Special-Just-in-Time-for-National-Pizza-Month/|title=Domino's has deal for national pizza month|publisher=PMQ Pizza Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some businesses run fundraising drives, donating proceeds of pizza sales to benefit various organizations or charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmq.com/October-2012/Pizza-Pizza-Closes-National-Pizza-Month-With-Fundraiser-for-Childrens-Miracle-Network/|title=Pizza Pizza Closes National Pizza Month With Fundraiser for Children's Miracle Network|publisher=PMQ Pizza Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODgtAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22National+pizza+month%22+fundraiser&amp;dq=%22National+pizza+month%22+fundraiser&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3C0_VOKZCMHCigLr3IGQBA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA|title=Pizza Today|publisher=Pizza Today|accessdate=16 October 2014|pages=8, 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restaurantnews.com/old-chicago-pizza-taproom-donating-1-from-select-specialty-pizzas-to-benefit-childrens-hospital-medical-center-this-month/|date=October 14, 2014|title=Old Chicago Pizza &amp; Taproom Donating $1 From Select Specialty Pizzas To Benefit Children’s Hospital &amp; Medical Center This Month|work=|accessdate=16 October 2014|publisher=Restaurant News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pizzerias create unique pizzas that they don't routinely offer.

'''Raffaele Esposito''' was the [[Italy|Italian]] owner of a [[tavern]] called [[Pizzeria di Pietro e Basta Cosi]] in the Nineteenth century, and is considered by some to be the father of modern [[pizza]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;&gt;Arthur Schwartz, ''Naples at Table: Cooking in Campania'' (1998), p. 68. {{ISBN|9780060182618}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickie&quot;&gt;John Dickie, ''Delizia!: The Epic History of the Italians and Their Food'' (2008), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1889, pizza had not yet become a popular or well-known dish, and was typically eaten by poor people as a way to use up various ingredients that would otherwise go to waste.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofmann&quot;&gt;Paul Hofmann, ''That Fine Italian Hand'' (1991), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Esposito was considered the premier pizza-maker in the city of [[Naples]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orsini&quot;&gt;Father Giuseppe Orsini, Joseph E. Orsini, ''Italian Baking Secrets'' (2007), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Esposito was therefore requested to prepare a pizza for Queen [[Margherita of Savoy]], who had traveled to Naples with [[King Umberto I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;/&gt; Esposito and his wife were admitted to the royal kitchens to prepare this dish as he saw fit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orsini&quot;/&gt; Deeming the traditional [[garlic]] topping to be unfit for the royal palate, Esposito instead prepared three different pizzas,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickie&quot;/&gt; the last of which used a combination of [[tomato]]es, [[mozzarella]] cheese and [[basil]] to emulate the red, white, and green of the [[Flag of Italy|Italian flag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;/&gt; It is claimed by some sources that this was the first time pizza was made with mozzarella cheese.&lt;ref&gt;James McNair, ''Pizza'' (1987), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Margherita, having never had pizza before, so enjoyed the dish that she had her head of table services send Esposito a letter to commend his pizzas, stating that they &quot;were found to be delicious&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;/&gt; Esposito used this recommendation to successfully [[Marketing|promote]] his restaurant,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;/&gt; naming the pizza most enjoyed by the Queen, &quot;[[Pizza Margherita]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Stradley, &quot;[http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Pizza/PizzaHistory.htm History and Legends of Pizza]&quot; (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is widely reported that this event caused pizza to become a fad,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orsini&quot;/&gt; from which it retained enduring popularity. Because of Esposito's experiments with ingredients and presentation, and his successful preparation of the dish for Queen Margherita, it is suggested by some that Esposito was the father of the modern pizza.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orsini&quot;/&gt; Esposito's restaurant still exists, although the name has been changed to Pizzeria di Brandi, and the royal letter favoring Esposito's pizza is on display in the restaurant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz&quot;/&gt;

'''Garlic knots''' are a type of [[garlic bread]] found primarily in [[pizzeria]]s around New York City and the surrounding regions. They were developed in 1973 in Ozone Park, Queens as a way of making use of pizza dough scraps, and very quickly caught on.  Interestingly, garlic-knots were created at the same pizzeria which introduced toppings (other than cheese) to pizza. 

The dough is rolled and then pulled into small, tight overhand knots, and pre-baked in a pizza oven (authentically, at temperatures of 700°F or higher). The knots are then dipped in or generously brushed with a mix of oil, parmesan cheese, and crushed garlic; variations can include finely chopped parsley, dried oregano, or black pepper. Before serving, garlic knots are baked a second time, and may be accompanied with marinara sauce.

As they're traditionally a way to make use of scraps, garlic knots tend to be the least expensive item on a pizzeria menu, often provided as complimentary with larger orders.

Garlic “Rolls” were invented at Rocco’s Italian Cuisine and Pizza (New City, NY) a few years later. Rocco’s is currently at the same location and the garlic rolls look and taste exactly the same.

The '''history of [[pizza]]''' begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced flatbreads with toppings. 

The precursor of pizza was probably the [[focaccia]], a flat bread known to the Romans as ''panis focacius'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiantourism.com/pane.html &quot;panis focacius denoted a flat bread cooked in the ashes (&quot;focus&quot; meant hearth)&quot; - ENIT North America]&lt;/ref&gt; to which toppings were then added.&lt;ref name=Treasures&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Burtan|title=Treasures of the Italian Table|year=1994|publisher=William Morrow and Company|isbn=978-0688115579|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern pizza developed in [[Naples]], when tomato was added to the focaccia in the late 18th century.

The word ''pizza'' was first documented in AD 997&amp;nbsp;in [[Gaeta]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Salvatore Riciniello (1987) ''Codice Diplomatico Gaetano'', Vol. I, La Poligrafica&lt;/ref&gt; and successively in different parts of [[Central Italy|Central]] and [[Southern Italy]]. Pizza was mainly eaten in the country of Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II, when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.

==Origins==
Foods similar to pizza have been made since the [[neolithic age]]. Records of people adding other ingredients to [[bread]] to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history.

* In [[Sardinia]], French and Italian archaeologists have found bread baked over 7,000 years ago. According to Professor Philippe Marinval, the local islanders leavened this bread.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sardegnaturismo.it/documenti/1_39_20060829130058.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Ancient Greeks]] had a flat bread called ''plakous'' (''πλακοῦς'', gen. ''πλακοῦντος''—''plakountos'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2383459 Plakous], Liddell and Scott, &quot;A Greek-English Lexicon&quot;, at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which was flavored with toppings like herbs, onion, and garlic.
* In the 6th century BC, the soldiers in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] King [[Darius I]] armies baked flatbreads with [[cheese]] and [[date (fruit)|date]]s on top of their battle shields.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Pizza, A Slice of American History&quot; Liz Barrett (2014), p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Science of Bakery Products&quot; W. P. Edwards (2007), p.199&lt;/ref&gt;
* An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the [[Aeneid]] (ca. 19 BC), when Celaeno, queen of the [[Harpies]], foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, [[Aeneas]] and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the &quot;tables&quot; prophesied by Celaeno.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dcc.dickinson.edu/eimmart-aeneas-and-trojans-fulfill-anchises-prophecy Aeneas and Trojans fulfill Anchises' prophecy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have suggested that the origins of modern pizza can be traced to ''pizzarelle'', which were [[Kashrut|kosher]] for [[Passover]] cookies eaten by Roman Jews after returning from the [[synagogue]] on that holiday, though some also trace its origins to other Italian paschal breads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nissan |first1=Ephraim |last2=Alinei |first2=Mario |date=2013 |title=Onomastics in Contemporary Public Space |chapter=The Pizza and the Pitta: The Thing and Its Names, Antecedents and Relatives, Ushering Into Globalization |editor1-last=Felecan |editor1-first=Oliviu |editor2-last=Bughesiu |editor2-first=Alina |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pvcwBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA328 |location= |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=1443852171}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abba Eban]] has suggested that modern pizza &quot;was first made more than 2000 years ago when Roman soldiers added cheese and olive oil to [[Matzo|matzah]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bamberger |first1=David |last2=Eban |first2=Abba Solomon |date=1979 |title=My People: Abba Eban's History of the Jews, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCBtWDabYwkC&amp;pg=PA228 |location= |publisher=Behrman House |page=228 |isbn=0874412803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of flatbreads that survive to this day from the ancient Mediterranean world are [[focaccia]] (which may date back as far as the ancient [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]); Mankoucheh in Lebanon, [[Coca (pastry)|coca]] (which has sweet and savory varieties) from [[Catalonia]]; [[Valencia (province)|Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]; the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Pita]]; [[Lepinja]] in the [[Balkans]]; or [[Piadina]] in the Romagna part of Emilia-Romagna in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitit.co.uk/foodrink/pide.html |title=Food and Drink - Pide - HiTiT Turkey guide |publisher=Hitit.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foods similar to flatbreads in other parts of the world include Chinese [[Bing (bread)|bing]] (a wheat flour-based Chinese food with a flattened or disk-like shape); the Indian [[paratha]] (in which fat is incorporated); the Central and South Asian [[naan]] (leavened) and [[roti]] (unleavened); the Sardinian [[Pane Carasau|carasau]], [[spianata]], [[guttiau]], [[pistoccu]]; and Finnish [[Breads of Finland#Rieska|rieska]]. Also worth noting is that throughout Europe there are many similar pies based on the idea of covering flat pastry with cheese, meat, vegetables and seasoning such as the Alsatian [[flammkuchen]], German [[zwiebelkuchen]], and French [[quiche]].

In 16th-century [[Naples]], a [[galette]] flatbread was referred to as a pizza. Known as the dish for poor people, it was sold in the street and was not considered a kitchen recipe for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobetravelagent.com/history-of-pizza-margherita-recipe/ |title=History of Pizza Margherita|publisher=tobetravelagent.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later replaced by oil, tomatoes (after Europeans came into contact with the Americas) or fish. In 1843, [[Alexandre Dumas, père]], described the diversity of pizza toppings.&lt;ref name=dumas&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexandre |last=Dumas |authorlink=Alexandre Dumas |title=Le Corricolo |year=1843 |edition=Oeuvres Complètes (1851) |page=91 |url=http://www.dumaspere.com/pages/bibliotheque/chapitre.php?lid=v4&amp;cid=9 |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An often recounted story holds that on 11 June 1889, to honour the Queen consort of [[Italy]], [[Margherita of Savoy]], the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] pizzamaker Raffaele Esposito created the &quot;Pizza Margherita&quot;, a pizza garnished with tomatoes, [[mozzarella]], and basil, to represent the [[national colours of Italy]] as on the [[Italian flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Vegetarian Times|title=Beyond Pizza|last=Danford|first=Natalie|number=109|date=October 1994|publisher=Active Interest Media|issn=0164-8497}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{sfn|Danford|p=38}} --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rallying to protect 'real' pizza|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=5 April 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- p=E08 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pizza purists out to protect patriotic pie|newspaper=[[Lakeland Ledger]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2 March 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- p=12A --&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: American Heritage article by Hanna Miller is not a reliable citation for this claim --&gt;

Pizza is now a type of bread and tomato dish, often served with cheese. However, until the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, the dish was sweet, not savory, and earlier versions which were savory more resembled the flat breads now known as [[schiacciata]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Grigorieva,  &quot;Naming Authenticity and Regional Italian Cuisine [https://books.google.com/books?lr=lang_en&amp;id=HflTVd898PAC&amp;dq=Pellegrino+Artusi&amp;q=pizza#v=snippet&amp;q=pizza&amp;f=false],&quot; in Richard Hosking, ed., ''Authenticity in the Kitchen: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 2005'' (Prospect Books, 2006): 211-216.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pellegrino Artusi]]'s classic early-twentieth-century cookbook, ''La Scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene'' gives three recipes for pizza, all of which are sweet.&lt;ref&gt;Pellegrino Artusi, ''La scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene'' (1911; rpr. Torino: Einaudi, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1927, Ada Boni's collection of regional cooking includes a recipe using tomatoes and mozzarella.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorieva, Naming Authenticity,&quot; p. 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovation==
The innovation that led to flat bread pizza was the use of [[tomato]] as a topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to [[Europe]] from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous (as some other fruits of the [[nightshade]] family are). However, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around [[Naples]] to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and so the pizza began.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of the city to try the local specialty.

[[Image:Pizzeria Port Alba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba]] in Naples]]

Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries, and pizzerias keep this old tradition alive today. It is possible to enjoy paper-wrapped pizza and a drink sold from open-air stands outside the premises. [[Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba]] in Naples is widely regarded as the city's first pizzeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/showassoc_eng.php?id=140 |title=Avpn |publisher=Pizzanapoletana.org |date=1984-09-28 |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purists, like the famous pizzeria &quot;Da Michele&quot; in Via C. Sersale (founded 1870),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damichele.net/ |title=Antica Pizzeria &quot;Da Michele&quot; dal 1870 |publisher=Damichele.net |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider there to be only two true pizzas—the [[Marinara sauce|marinara]] and the margherita—and that is all they serve. These two &quot;pure&quot; pizzas are the ones preferred by many Italians today.

The marinara is the older of the two and has a topping of tomato, [[oregano]], [[garlic]], and [[extra virgin olive oil]]. It is named “marinara” because it was traditionally the food prepared by &quot;la marinara&quot;, the seaman's wife, for her seafaring husband when he returned from fishing trips in the [[Gulf of Naples|Bay of Naples]].

The margherita is topped with modest amounts of tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and fresh basil. It is widely attributed to baker [[Raffaele Esposito]], who worked at &quot;Pizzeria di Pietro&quot;, established in 1880. Though recent research casts doubt on this legend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tale holds that, in 1889, he baked three different pizzas for the visit of King [[Umberto I of Italy|Umberto I]] and Queen [[Margherita of Savoy]]. The Queen's favorite was a pizza evoking the colors of the Italian flag—green ([[basil]] leaves), white ([[mozzarella]]), and red ([[tomato]]es).&lt;ref name=amherit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=American Pie |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_30.shtml |quote=Cheese, the crowning ingredient, was not added until 1889, when the Royal Palace commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three contenders he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pie swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). |work=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |date=April–May 2006 |accessdate=2009-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712030514/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_30.shtml |archivedate=2009-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tale, this combination was named Pizza Margherita in her honor. Although those were the most preferred, today there are many variations of pizzas.

&quot;Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pizzanapoletana1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/index_eng.php |title=Avpn - Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana |publisher=Pizzanapoletana.org |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;True Neapolitan Pizza Association&quot;), which was founded in 1984, has set the very specific rules that must be followed for an authentic Neapolitan pizza. These include that the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed oven; that the base must be hand-kneaded and must not be rolled with a pin or prepared by any mechanical means (''i pizzaioli''—the pizza makers—make the pizza by rolling it with their fingers) and that the pizza must not exceed 35 centimetres in diameter or be more than one-third of a centimetre thick at the centre. The association also selects pizzerias all around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana philosophy and method.

There are many famous pizzerias in Naples where these traditional pizzas can be found such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo, Trianon, and Umberto (founded: 1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umberto.it/ |title=Benvenuti su umberto.it |publisher=Umberto.it |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them are in the ancient historical centre of Naples. These pizzerias will go even further than the specified rules by, for example, using only [[San Marzano tomato]]es grown on the slopes of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in only a clockwise direction.

The pizza bases in Naples are soft and pliable. In Rome they prefer a thin and crispy base. Another popular form of pizza in Italy is &quot;[[pizza al taglio]]&quot;, which is pizza baked in rectangular trays with a wide variety of toppings and sold by weight.

In 1962, the &quot;Hawaiian&quot; pizza, a pizza topped with pineapple and ham, was invented in Canada by restaurateur Sam Panopoulis at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Nosowitz |title=Meet the 81-Year-Old Greek-Canadian Inventor of the Hawaiian Pizza|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-inventor-of-hawaiian-pizza |work=[[Atlas Obscura]] |location=Unknown |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, the pizza napoletana was granted [[Protected Geographical Status|Traditional Speciality Guaranteed]] status by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Hooper |title=Pizza napoletana awarded special status by EU |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/09/italian-pizza-wins-protected-status |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the world's largest pizza was made in Rome, and was measured to be 1261.65 square metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-pizza|title=Largest pizza|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the pizza napoletana was inscribed on the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Naples' pizza twirling wins Unesco ‘intangible’ status |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/naples-pizza-twirling-wins-unesco-intangible-status |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=7 December 2017 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pizza in Canada==
[[Canada]] was first introduced to pizza in the late 1950s, with the first pizza ovens entering the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=02f306cd-5f68-4472-82d8-af9524003ec1 |title=Bringing the first pizza ovens to Canada in the 1950s|publisher=Canada.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country. Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small [[pizzerias]]. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and [[poutine]], salad, and [[calzones]]. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.

The most distinct pizza in Canada is the &quot;Canadian&quot; pizza. A “Canadian” pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with &quot;Canadian bacon&quot;, or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.

In Canada, pizza is served on a variety of crust types, including a traditional-style pan crust, a thin crust, multi-grain crust, whole-grain crust, and a gluten-free crust. Stuffed-crust pizza is also a popular pizza alternative for Canadian customers. It contains pizza toppings of the customer’s choice on a mozzarella-filled crust.

In the province of Quebec [[Pizza-ghetti]] is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese

Some of Canada’s successful pizza brands include: [[Boston Pizza]], [[Pizza Pizza]], and Vanelli’s. Boston Pizza, also known as BP’s in Canada, and &quot;Boston's—the Gourmet Pizza&quot; in the United States and Mexico, is one of Canada’s largest franchising restaurants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boston Pizza Company History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bostonpizza.com/assets/mediacentre/documents/pdf/Boston_Pizza_-_Company_History.pdf |title=Boston Pizza Company History |publisher=bostonpizza.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand has opened over 325 locations across Canada and 50 locations in Mexico and the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boston Pizza Company History&quot;/&gt; The first Boston Pizza location was opened in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1964, and operated under the name &quot;Boston Pizza &amp; Spaghetti House&quot;, with locations still opening across the nation.

The brand continued to open additional locations across the Middle East, with chains now opened in the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanellisrestaurants.com/en/locations |title=locations|publisher=vanellisrestaurant.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 110 locations worldwide; making Vanelli’s the first pizza brand in Canada to open locations internationally.

With pizza gaining popularity across the nation, major American pizza chains such as [[Pizza Hut]], [[Domino’s Pizza]] and [[Little Caesars]] have expanded their locations in Canada, competing against the domestic Canadian brands. The major American pizza chains have brought their signature classic pizza recipes and toppings into their Canadian chains, offering their traditional classic pizzas to Canadian customers. However, the American chains have also created Canadian specialty pizzas that are available only in Canada. Pizzas that have been made exclusively for Canada by the American chain Pizza Hut for a limited time, included the following:

* Hot Dog [[Stuffed crust pizza|Stuffed Crust Pizza]]: an angus beef hot dog, placed inside a stuffed crust, served in a medium or large pizza, with toppings of the customer’s choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pizza Hut Pizzas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/06/11/new-pizza-hut-pizzas_n_3423659.html |title=New Pizza Hut Pizzas |publisher=huffingtonpost.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Grilled Chicken Club: a spin on Canada’s popular sandwich that is served with an alfredo sauce, grilled chicken strips, bacon, diced tomatoes, lettuce, mozzarella cheese and a pepper mayo sauce.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pizza Hut Pizzas&quot;/&gt;
* Smokey Maple Bacon Pizza: a pizza served with Alfredo sauce, maple bacon strips, bacon crumble, sliced mushrooms, shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pizza Hut Pizzas&quot;/&gt;

Pizza first made its appearance in the [[United States]] with the arrival of Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and was very popular among large Italian populations in [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[St. Louis|Saint Louis]]. In the late 19th century, pizza was introduced by peddlers who walked up and down the streets with a metal washtub of pizzas on their heads, selling their pizzas at two cents a slice. It was not long until small cafes and groceries began offering pizzas to their [[Italian American]] communities.

The first printed reference to &quot;pizza&quot; served in the US is a 1904 article in ''[[The Boston Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adam |last=Kuban |url=http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2009/01/dear-slice-boston-may-have-had-the-first-pizza-in-the-us.html |title=Dear Slice: Boston May Have Had the First Pizza in America |department=Dear Slice (blog) |publisher=Serious Eats |date=January 5, 2009 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanni and Gennaro Bruno came to America from Naples, Italy in 1903 to introduce the Neapolitan Pizza.{{clarify|date=July 2014|reason=Did they immigrate, or was it a business trip?}} Vincent (Jimmy) Bruno (Giovanni's son) went on to open the first pizzeria in [[Chicago Loop|The Loop]] in Chicago at 421 S. Wabash Avenue, the Yacht Club. Gennaro Lombardi opened a grocery store in 1897 which was later established as the &quot;said&quot; first pizzeria in America in 1905 with New York's issuance of the mercantile license. An employee of his, Antonio Totonno Pero, began making pizza for the store to sell that same year. The price for a pizza was five cents, but since many people could not afford the cost of a whole pie, they would instead say how much they could pay and they were given a slice corresponding to the amount offered. In 1924, Totonno left [[Lombardi's]] to open his own pizzeria on [[Coney Island]] called [[Totonno's]]. While the original Lombardi's closed its doors in 1984, it was reopened in 1994 just down the street and is run by Lombardi's grandson.

Pizza was brought to the [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] area of [[New Jersey]] with Joe's Tomato Pies opening in 1910, followed soon by [[Papa's Tomato Pies]] in 1912. In 1936, [[De Lorenzo's Tomato Pies]] was opened. While Joe's Tomato Pies has closed, both Papa's and Delorenzo's have been run by the same families since their openings and remain among the most popular pizzas in the area. [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana]] in [[New Haven]], Connecticut, was another early pizzeria which opened in 1925 (after the owner served pies from local carts and bakeries for 20–25 years) and is famous for its New Haven–style Clam Pie. Frank Pepe's nephew Sal Consiglio opened a competing store, [[Sally's Apizza]], on the other end of the block, in 1938. Both establishments are still run by descendants of the original family. When Sal died, over 2,000 people attended his wake, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a half-page memoriam. The D'Amore family introduced pizza to [[Los Angeles]] in 1939.

Before the 1940s, pizza consumption was limited mostly to Italian immigrants and their descendants. The international breakthrough came after World War II. Allied troops occupying Italy, weary of their rations, were constantly on the lookout for good food. They discovered the pizzeria and local bakers were hard-pressed to satisfy the demand from the soldiers. The American troops involved in the Italian campaign took their appreciation for the dish back home, touted by &quot;veterans ranging from the lowliest private to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]&quot;.{{cite quote|date=January 2017}} By the 1960s, it was popular enough to be featured in an episode of [[Popeye the Sailor (1960s TV series)|Popeye the Sailor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon-story/52506-Popeyes-Pizza-Palace Popeye's Pizza Palace], The Big Cartoon Database&lt;/ref&gt;

Two entrepreneurs, Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo, invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, in 1943. They opened their own restaurant on the corner of Wabash and Ohio, [[Uno Chicago Grill|Pizzeria Uno]].

Chain restaurants sprang up with pizza's popularity rising. Leading early pizza chains were [[Shakey's Pizza]], founded in 1954 in [[Sacramento]], California; [[Pizza Hut]], founded in 1958 in [[Wichita, Kansas]]; and Josey's Pizza founded in [[Newnan]], Georgia, in 1943. Later entrant restaurant chains to the dine-in pizza market were [[Bertucci's]], [[Happy Joe's]], [[Monical's Pizza]], [[California Pizza Kitchen]], [[Godfather's Pizza]], and [[Round Table Pizza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlhU8-nAw2k |title=CBC Archives: New 50's Food - Pizza! 1957 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pizza}}

The '''pizza box''' or '''pizza package''' is a folding [[box]] made of [[cardboard]] in which hot [[pizzas]] are stored in for [[takeaway]]. The &quot;pizza box&quot; also makes [[home delivery]] and [[takeaway]] substantially easier. The pizza box has to be highly resistant, cheap, stackable, thermally insulated to regulate humidity and suitable for food transportation. In addition, it provides space for advertising. The pizza packages differ from those of frozen pizzas, which contain the frozen product in heat-sealed plastic foils as is the case with much [[frozen food]].

== History ==
[[File:Pizza box collection point Old Orchard Beach ME.jpg|thumb|upright|A pizza box collection point at Old Orchard Beach, Maine]]
Containers to deliver freshly baked pizzas have existed at least since the 19th century, when [[Neapolitan pizza|Neapolitan]] pizza bakers put their products in multi-layered metallic containers known as ''stufe'' (singular ''stufa'', &quot;oven&quot;) and then sent them to the street sellers. The aerated container was round and made of tin or copper.&lt;ref name=&quot;blu63&quot;&gt;[[Heston Blumenthal]]: ''In Search of Perfection.'' Bloomsbury Publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7475-8409-5}}, S.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt;
Disposable packaging started to be developed in the [[United States]], after the [[Second World War]]. At that time pizza was becoming increasingly popular and the first pizza delivery services were created. In the beginning they attempted to deliver pizzas in simple cardboard boxes, similar to those used in cake shops, but these often became wet, bent or even broke in two. Other pizza chefs tried to put pizzas on plates and transport them inside paper bags. This partly solved the problem. However, it was almost impossible to transport at the same time more pizzas inside one bag. In this way, the pizzas on the top would have ruined the surface of the others.&lt;ref name=&quot;mad&quot; /&gt;

The first patent for a pizza box made of [[corrugated cardboard]] was applied in 1963 and it already displayed the characteristics of today's pizza packaging: plane blanks, foldability without need of adhesive, stackability and ventilation slots.&lt;ref name=&quot;USP3163344&quot;&gt;Abraham L. Tunick, Container, [http://www.ptodirect.com/Results/Patents?query=PN/3163344 U.S. Patent 3,163,344] erteilt am 29. Dezember 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of such slots along with water vapour absorbing materials ([[Absorption of water|absorption agent]]) prevented the humidity build-ups that characterized traditional transport packaging.&lt;ref name=&quot;USP3163344&quot; /&gt;
It is assumed that the pizza box was invented by [[Domino's Pizza]], even if they did not file a [[patent]] application.&lt;ref name=&quot;mad&quot; /&gt; Until 1988 this chain employed a type of packaging whose front side was not directly connected to the lateral sides,&lt;ref name=&quot;CorrellHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Pizza Packaging, Overview &amp; History|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.correllconcepts.com/Pizza_Packaging/history.htm|deadurl=|accessdate=2012-03-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825231309/http://www.correllconcepts.com/Pizza_Packaging/history.htm|archivedate=2012-08-25|last=John Correll|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather the flaps fixed to the lateral sides were folded inward under the lid. This design is also known as &quot;Chicago folding&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CorrellHistory&quot; /&gt; Domino's was the first pizza producer which employed pizza boxes on a large scale and in this way expanded its delivery range beyond the area immediately close to the pizzeria.&lt;ref name=&quot;hai241&quot;&gt;Matt Haig: ''Brand Success: How the World's Top 100 Brands Thrive and Survive.'' Kogan Page Publishers, 2011, {{ISBN|0-7494-6287-6}}, S. 241. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=DVL8R8yz0xEC&amp;pg=PA241 Google Vorschau])&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 1960s, the delivery service was further developed thanks to the introduction of heat-insulating bags.&lt;ref name=&quot;USP3428103&quot;&gt;Jean L. Walsh, Insulated Container for Pizza Pies, [http://www.ptodirect.com/Results/Patents?query=PN/3428103 U.S. Patent 3,428,103] erteilt am 18. Februar 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Requirements ==

=== Stability and stackability ===
[[File:Pizzakarton Traditional.svg|thumb|'Traditional' way of folding a pizza box]]
Most packaging for the transport of pizzas is made of [[cardboard]], because this material is cheap and has many useful properties. Both solid fibre board and single wall corrugated board are used. The corrugated cardboard in use is often of the E flute size (micro or fine waves with a flute pitch of 1.0 to 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm), but thicker B flute cardboard with a flute pitch of 2.2 to 3.0&amp;nbsp;mm are also used.&lt;ref name=&quot;CorrellStructuralOptions&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Pizza Packaging, Structural Options, Pros &amp; Cons|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.correllconcepts.com/Pizza_Packaging/structural%20_options.htm|deadurl=|accessdate=2012-03-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819160624/http://www.correllconcepts.com/Pizza_Packaging/structural%20_options.htm|archivedate=2012-08-19|last=John Correll|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only the geometric construction of the cardboard determines the stability of the box, but also especially the type of paper and its grammage. For the liner mostly [[containerboard]] is used on the inside of the box. This does not only make the box stable, it becomes more resistant against humidity and oil as well.
To reduce the space needed to store the packaging to a minimum, the pizza boxes are folded just before use out of flat blanks. The required storage space depends very much on the different thickness of the material.&lt;ref name=&quot;CorrellStructuralOptions&quot; /&gt;

Pizza boxes made from solid fibre board take up about half the space the boxes with E flute size cardboard need, and a quarter of the space of those made of B flute size cardboard. Apart from the material itself, the stability of the box is determined by the form it is folded into. The type of pizza box with flaps firmly attached to the side walls that are folded into the front wall has established itself as the standard. In this case, the walls of the box are connected at the edges and this increases its stability. The traditional way of folding the box is an example of this folding type. Its disadvantage is that the walls of the box rise vertically which makes cutting the pizza in the box with a [[pizza cutter]] more difficult.

=== Heat insulation and humidity regulation ===
[[File:Pizzakarton Lueftungsoeffnung 2011.jpg|thumb|left|The opening on the side of the box allows water to evaporate]]
The pizza box is supposed to allow the transport of a baked pizza with the minimum loss in quality possible. This means the box has two tasks to fulfill that are not easy to combine: On the one hand, the box should [[Thermal insulation|insulate]] as well as possible against the cold air outside, the occasional wind and heat radiation, in order to keep the pizza warm. To reduce heat flow the box has to close as firmly as possible to keep the warm air inside. Consumers consider a temperature between 70 and 85&amp;nbsp;°C to be ideal for pizza consumption. On the other hand, the box should keep the pizza from getting soggy, so that the crust and the covering are crisp on arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Patrizia Fava|Surname2=Luciano Piergiovanni|Surname3=Ella Pagliarini|Periodical=Packaging Technology and Science|Title=Design of a functional box for take-away pizza |Volume=12|Issue=2|Publisher=Wiley|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;57–65|ISSN=1099-1522|language=German|DOI=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1522(199903/04)12:2&lt;57::AID-PTS447&gt;3.0.CO;2-R}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure this, the condesation caused by the pizza must be let out (airing holes and some diffusion through the cardboard) or absorbed by the box. Pizza boxes made of single wall corrugated board that are not equipped with additional insulation cool the transported pizza down too far after just ten minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Patrizia Fava|Surname2=Luciano Piergiovanni|Surname3=Ella Pagliarini|Periodical=Packaging Technology and Science|Title=Design of a functional box for take-away pizza |Volume=12|Issue=2|Publisher=Wiley|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;57–65|ISSN=1099-1522|language=German|DOI=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1522(199903/04)12:2&lt;57::AID-PTS447&gt;3.0.CO;2-R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil in the pizza dough can extract some of the essence in the cellulose when in contact with untreated corrugated cardboard. To prevent a change in the taste of the pizza through the material of the pizza box and simultaneously to stop the cardboard from getting soggy the pizza boxes have a thin coating of aluminium foil on the inside. Another possibility is to lay the pizza on aluminium foil, a mixture of corrugated cardboard and blotting paper, or waxed paper. However, this changes the thermodynamic properties of the pizza box considerably. The pizza crust cannot give up any humidity downwards, meaning the layer beneath does not only impede fat from trickling down but also steam.

== For pizza delivery ==

=== Pizza saver ===
{{main article|Pizza saver}}
In the US, many pizza boxes include a spacer made of heat-resistant plastic (usually ([[polypropylene]]) placed in the middle of the pizza. It is called the 'pizza saver' (also known as 'package saver', 'box tent', 'pizza table' or 'pizza lid support').&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blpackagesaver.htm About.com: Package Saver].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkleysquare.net/berkleysquare/pizza_lid_supports.php Produktbeschreibung: Pizza Lid Support].&lt;/ref&gt;
This stops the box lid from touching the pizza and prevents toppings (such as cheese) from sticking to the lid when it is being delivered.&lt;ref name=&quot;mad&quot;&gt;Alexis Madrigal: [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/07/the-3-big-advances-in-the-technology-of-the-pizza-box/242116/ ''The 3 Big Advances in the Technology of the Pizza Box'']. In: ''The Atlantic''. 18. Juli 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
The 'pizza saver's' origin goes back to a 1985 patent, taken out by the American [[Carmela Vitale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pet&quot;&gt;Henry Petroski: ''[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/4/a-round-pie-in-a-square-box/1 A Round Pie in a Square Box.]'' In: ''American Scientist.'' Juli–August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=4498586&amp;KC=&amp;FT=E&amp;locale=en_EP Europäisches Patentamt], retrieved, 26 October 2011 (Englishmen).&lt;/ref&gt; The little piece of plastic called the spacer is often criticized for being a waste of resources as it is only used once and then thrown away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myplasticfreelife.com/2010/05/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-plastic-thing-in-the-middle-of-the-pizza Kritik am Pizza saver] (englisch).&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, ideas for its [[reuse]] are being developed.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Bags and boxes for transport ===
[[File:Domino's Pizza Motor Bikes.jpg|thumb|Domino's Pizza motor bikes that are used for pizza home delivery in Goa, India, with transport boxes mounted atop]]
There are special padded transport bags and boxes for the delivery of pizzas in pizza boxes that are fitted to the typical sizes of pizza boxes. Some of these bags can be heated in order to keep the temperature at the desired level. Mostly, they can either be plugged to a socket or powered by the 12 volt car battery. This means that the insulation of pizza boxes themselves is less important.
Pizza boxes with pizzas inside should be held horizontally at all times and should be protected against high acceleration to the sides and impact. To ensure this, there are usually handles on either side of the carry bags for carrying. Combined, these handles allow the box to be carried in one hand by the side of the body. Carry bags insulate best when their lid is connected to the rest of the bag on one side and the remaining three sides can be attached to lid by a zip. A bag can contain about three to five pizza boxes, which is usually enough for one delivery address. If more pizzas have to be delivered a higher bag is used or two regular bags are placed on top of each other and carried with both hands in front of the body.

=== Pizza box with thermometer ===
The pizza boxes by [[Pizza Hut]] in [[Morocco]] and other countries have a [[thermometer]] indicator on the outside which colour codes the temperature of the pizza inside, letting the outside world know about what is going on inside. When the pizza is hot the indicator shows the words 'HOT' in red letters on a white background. However, if the temperature of the pizza goes below a certain value the 'Hot Dot' turns black and the words are not longer legible. If the pizza is delivered to the receiver cold, then the next delivery is free of charge. The thermondicator is intended for one use only.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wiemer: [http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2011/04/take-a-tour-of-pizza-boxes-of-the-world.html?ref=excerpt_readmore ''Take a ‘Tour’ of Pizza Boxes of the World''], privates Video über besondere Pizzakartons aus verschiedenen Ländern (Englisch), retrieved, 15 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Safety &amp; Hygiene Thermometers &amp; Temperature Indicators|trans-title=|periodical=www.lcrhallcrest.com|publisher=|url=http://www.lcrhallcrest.com/food-hygiene-products/case-studies.php?id=8|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2016-02-25|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible contaminations ==

=== 2,6-Diisopropylnaphthalene (2,6-DIPN) ===
[[DIPN]] is used as a solvent in certain kinds of paper. These can be part of scrap paper which is used in the manufacturing of packaging like the pizza box. Direct contact or evaporation can transfer DIPN from the packaging onto the packed food, contaminating it. Especially food containing fat like pizza with a layer of cheese can absorb DIPN.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAVES&quot;&gt;Niedersächsischen Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit: [http://www.laves.niedersachsen.de/portal/live.php?navigation_id=20045&amp;article_id=73005&amp;_psmand=23 Kernlösemittel DIPN in Verpackungen: 8 von 128 Proben beanstandet], Presseinformation Nr. 063. 17 December 2004. Accessed 5 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, there is no knowledge of danger to the health of the consumer. Still, paper contaminated with DIPN must not be used in the food sector in order to minimise danger of contamination.&lt;ref&gt;Bericht über die 109.

{{pizza}}

During the latter half of the 20th century, [[pizza]] became a globally accessible dish, mainly due to [[Italian immigrants]] that had brought their dishes to new people with resounding success, often in racially and culturally resistive environments.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

A survey from 2004 showed that [[Norwegians]] eat the most frozen pizza (5.4&amp;nbsp;kg/person*year), followed by [[Germans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/norrmannen-varldsbast-pa-att-ata-pizza_1042389.svd|title=Norrmännen världsbäst på att äta pizza|author=Maria Wahlberg|date=13 January 2005|work=SvD.se|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh ===
Pizza became a popular fast food in [[Bangladesh]]i urban areas. Since the introduction of various pizza brands such as [[Domino's]] and [[Pizza Hut]] in the early to mid-2000s, it has reached almost all classes of urban peoples.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== India ===
[[File:Tandoori Paneer from India.jpg|thumb|A [[Tandoor]]i [[Paneer]] pizza from India.]]
Pizza is an emerging fast food in [[India]]n urban areas. American pizza chains [[Domino's Pizza]] and [[Pizza Hut]] opened their first outlets in India in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/company-facts/jubilantfoodworks/history/JF04 |title=Company History of Jubilant Foodworks |publisher=Moneycontrol.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Kretzmann&quot;/&gt; Domestic pizza brands include U.S.Pizza, [[Smokin' Joes]] and [[Pizza Corner]]. Branded pizza is available in most cities in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;jubilantfoodworks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jubilantfoodworks.com/brand/|title=Brand - Jubilant FoodWorks Ltd - JFL &amp;#124; Dunkin' Donut &amp;#124; Domino's Pizza &amp;#124; Jubilant FoodWorks Limited|publisher=jubilantfoodworks.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizzas served in India by foreign pizza brands feature greater &quot;recipe localization&quot; from pizza makers than many other markets such as Latin America and Europe, but similar to other Asian pizza markets. Indian pizzas are generally spicier and more vegetable-oriented than those in other countries. For instance, oregano spice packs are included with a typical pizza order in India instead of Parmesan cheese.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kretzmann&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kretzmann |first=David |url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/21/how-dominos-is-poised-to-benefit-from-india.aspx |title=How Domino's Is Poised to Benefit From India |publisher=Fool.com |date=2013-12-21 |accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to spicier and more vegetable-oriented ingredients, Indian pizza also utilized unique toppings. For example, a pizza topping unique to India would be pickled ginger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thornhill, Jan 2010&quot;&gt;Thornhill, Jan. Who Wants Pizza?: The Kids' Guide to the History, Science &amp; Culture of Food. Toronto: Maple Tree, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizza outlets serve pizzas with several Indian-style toppings, such as tandoori chicken and [[paneer]]. More conventional pizzas are also eaten. Pizzas available in India range from localized basic variants, available in neighborhood bakeries, to gourmet pizzas with exotic and imported ingredients available at specialty restaurants.

=== Indonesia ===
[[File:Pizza-balado.jpg|thumb|right|Spicy Pizza [[Balado (food)|Balado]], an [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]] fusion cuisine ]]
In [[Indonesia]], [[Pizza Hut]] is the largest pizza chain restaurant who entered Indonesia in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pizza Hut Indonesia | url = https://www.pizzahut.co.id/}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Domino Pizza]] and Papa Ron's Pizza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = papa Ron's | url = http://www.paparonspizza.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular pizza recipes such as meat lover with pepperoni, tuna with melt cheese, and beef blackpepper exist in Indonesia. Those recipes are originated either from United States or Italy, thus derived from [[Western world|western]] counterpart. 

However, there are also Asian [[Eastern world|eastern]] pizza which includes Indonesian [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] pizza that combine [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian favourite]] as pizza toppings — such as [[satay]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Tempo-pizza&quot;&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = Tempo.co | title = Beef Satay Pizza of Blue Jasmine | date = 20 January 2015 | url = https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2015/01/20/199636148/Beef-Satay-Pizza-of-Blue-Jasmine}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Balado (food)|balado]] and [[rendang]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JP-pizza&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Seven pizzas that are more Indonesian than Italian | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | date = 10 February 2017 | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/02/10/seven-pizzas-that-are-more-indonesian-than-italian.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
American pizza chains entered [[Japan]] in the 1970s (e.g. [[Shakey's Pizza]] and Pizza Hut 1973, Domino's pizza in 1985). The largest Japanese pizza chain is [[Pizza-La]]. Local types of pizza are popular, with many using mayonnaise sauces, and sometimes other ingredients such as corn, potatoes, avocado, eel, or even honey or chocolate (as in dessert). &quot;Side orders&quot; also often include items such as french fries, fried chicken, baked pasta, as well as vegetable soups, green salads, desserts, and soda or Japanese tea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pizza-la.co.jp/sc_englishmenu.aspx PizzaLa English menu Retrieved 2014-04-26.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a strong tradition of using [[Tabasco sauce]] on cooked pizzas.

Pizza toppings in Japan also differ from that found in the United States. One of the unique pizza toppings found in Japan is squid. Seafood may be found on pizza everywhere, but having squid as the focal ingredient is unique to Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thornhill, Jan 2010&quot;/&gt;

Local crust variants also exist, for instance mochi pizza (crust made with Japanese [[mochi]] cakes).&lt;ref&gt;Ceccarini R.

Brill Publishers, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional pizza served in Italian-style restaurants are also popular, and the most popular pizza chain promoting Italian style artisanal pizza is [[Salvatore Cuomo]]. The Italian association Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana also has an independent branch in Japan.

=== Korea ===
Pizza is a popular snack food in [[South Korea]], especially among younger people.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Major American brands such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and [[Papa John's Pizza]] compete against domestic brands such as [[Mr. Pizza Korea|Mr. Pizza]] and [[Pizza Etang]], offering traditional as well as local varieties which may include toppings such as [[bulgogi]] and [[dak galbi]]. Korean-style pizza tends to be complicated, and often has nontraditional toppings such as corn, potato wedges, sweet potato, shrimp, or crab. Traditional Italian-style thin-crust pizza is served in the many Italian restaurants in [[Seoul]] and other major cities. 
[[North Korea]]'s first pizzeria opened in its capital [[Pyongyang]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7945816.stm | work=BBC News | title=First North Korean pizzeria opens | date=2009-03-16 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first pizzerias opened in [[Karachi]] and [[Islamabad]] in the late 1980s, with Pappasallis serving pizza in Islamabad since 1990. Pizza has gained a measure of popularity in the eastern regions of Pakistan—namely, the provinces of [[Sindh]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], and [[P.O.K]], as well as the autonomous territory of [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]. Pizza has not penetrated into western Pakistan; of the remaining provinces and territories of Pakistan, only one ([[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]) has seen much of the dish, in the form of a single [[Pizza Hut]] in [[Peshawar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/food-beverage/restaurants-food-service-restaurants-fast/8006760-1.html |title=Foreign food franchises.

Authentic [[Neapolitan pizza]]s (''pizza napoletana'') are typically made with tomatoes and [[mozzarella]] cheese. They can be made with ingredients like [[San Marzano tomato]]es, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of [[Mount Vesuvius]], and [[Buffalo Mozzarella|mozzarella di bufala Campana]], made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of [[Campania]] and [[Lazio]] in a semi-wild state (this mozzarella is protected with its own European [[protected designation of origin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/qual/it/147_it.htm |title=Selezione geografica |publisher=Europa.eu.int |date=2009-02-23 |accessdate=2009-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050218123118/http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/qual/it/147_it.htm |archivedate=2005-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the rules proposed by the ''Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/index_eng.php |title=''Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana'' |publisher=Pizzanapoletana.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the genuine Neapolitan pizza dough consists of wheat flour ([[Flour#Flour type numbers|type ''0'' or ''00'']], or a mixture of both), natural Neapolitan yeast or brewer's yeast, salt and water. For proper results, strong flour with high protein content (as used for bread-making rather than cakes) must be used. The dough must be kneaded by hand or with a low-speed mixer. After the rising process, the dough must be formed by hand without the help of a rolling pin or other machine, and may be no more than {{convert|3|mm|in|sp=us}} thick. The pizza must be baked for 60–90 seconds in a {{convert|485|C}} stone oven with an oak-wood fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fornobravo.com/vera_pizza_napoletana/VPN_spec.html|title=Vera Pizza Napoletana Specification &amp;#124; Verace Pizza Napoletana |publisher=Fornobravo.com |date=2004-05-24 |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When cooked, it should be crispy, tender and fragrant.  There are three official variants: ''[[pizza marinara]]'', which is made with tomato, garlic, oregano and extra virgin olive oil, ''[[pizza Margherita]]'', made with tomato, sliced mozzarella, basil and extra-virgin olive oil, and ''pizza Margherita extra'' made with tomato, mozzarella from Campania in fillets, basil and extra virgin olive oil.

Pizza in [[Lazio]] ([[Rome]]), as well as in many other parts of Italy, is available in two different styles. Take-away shops sell ''pizza rustica'' or ''[[pizza al taglio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPwjiocwXFwC&amp;pg=PP37&amp;dq=Lazio,+pizza+al+taglio |title=Lonely Planet Rome | authors = Duncan Garwood, Abigail Hole |publisher=Lonely Planet |date= 2012-05-01|accessdate=2013-07-04|isbn=9781742208428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pizza is cooked in long, rectangular baking pans and relatively thick (1–2&amp;nbsp;cm). The pizza is often cooked in an electric oven. It is usually cut with scissors or a knife and sold by weight. In pizzerias, pizza is served in a dish in its traditional round shape. It has a thin, crisp base quite different from the thicker and softer Neapolitan style base. It is usually cooked in a [[wood-fired oven]], giving the pizza its unique flavor and texture. In Rome, a ''[[pizza napoletana]]'' is topped with tomato, mozzarella, anchovies and oil (thus, what in [[Naples]] is called ''pizza romana'', in Rome is called ''pizza napoletana''). Other types of Lazio-style pizza include
* ''pizza romana'' (tomato, mozzarella, anchovies, oregano, oil)
* ''pizza [[Viennese cuisine|viennese]]'' (tomato, mozzarella, German sausage, oregano, oil)

==== Bill for traditional Italian pizza ====
There was a bill before the [[Italian Parliament]] in 2002 to safeguard the ''traditional Italian pizza'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/showText?tipodoc=Ddlpres&amp;leg=13&amp;id=00007353&amp;offset=4504&amp;length=6529 |title=Bill for traditional Italian pizza |publisher=Senato.it |date= |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifying permissible ingredients and methods of processing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senato.it/leg/13/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/testi/13214_testi.htm |title=Permissible ingredients and methods of processing |publisher=Senato.it |date= |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., excluding frozen pizzas). Only pizzas which followed these guidelines could be called &quot;traditional Italian pizzas&quot; in Italy. On 9 December 2009, the [[European Union]], upon Italian request, granted [[Traditional Speciality Guaranteed]] (TSG) safeguard to traditional Neapolitan pizza, in particular to &quot;Margherita&quot; and &quot;Marinara&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110715092118/http://www.pizzamarketplace.com/article/96776/EU-grants-Neapolitan-pizza-Traditional-Specialty-Guaranteed-label EU grants Neapolitan pizza Traditional Specialty Guaranteed label], Pizza Marketplace&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union enacted a [[protected designation of origin]] system in the 1990s.

=== Malta ===

One style of fast-food pizza is the typical ''pizza kwadra'' (square pizza), which is found in [[Pastizzi]] shops (''pastizzeriji''), a deep-[[pan pizza]] cut into squares, generally topped with either green olives (''taż-żebbuġ''), hard boiled egg and cocktail sausage (''bajd u zalzett''), or chicken and barbecue sauce (''tat-tiġieġ''). A typical ''Pizzerija'' restaurant will offer a vast number of different pizza recipes, mostly based on the Italian style ones. A typical menu would include:

* Margherita: [[tomato sauce]], [[mozzarella]]
* Funghi: tomato sauce, mozzarella, [[mushroom]]s
* Capricciosa: tomato sauce, mozzarella, mushrooms, [[ham]], [[egg]]s, [[artichoke]], [[cocktail sausage]]s, [[green olive]]s

* Kebabpizza: tomato sauce, mozzarella, [[Doner kebab|döner kebab]], onion, green [[peperoncini]], (kebab sauce poured over after baking)
* Mexicana: tomato sauce, mozzarella, various recipes with minced beef, [[jalapeño]]s, sweet corn, onion, spicy sauce and other hot ingredients

Pizza has become a household dish. Nevertheless, the traditional Maltese pizza consists of a typical Maltese [[ftira]] covered in cheese (mainly local [[gbejna]]), onions and potatoes. In fact, it is most often known simply as &quot;ftira&quot; and is mainly sold on the island of [[Gozo]]. Different toppings can be added, including tuna, olives, anchovies, sundried tomatoes, and even traditional Maltese sausage.

=== Norway ===
Norwegians eat the most pizza in the world according to a 2004 survey by [[ACNielsen]] 2004, 5,4&amp;nbsp;kg/year per capita. 50&amp;nbsp;million frozen pizzas were sold that year, with consumption being 22,000 [[ton]]s of frozen pizza, 15,000 tons of home-baked and 13,000 tons of restaurant-made pizzas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/norrmannen-varldsbast-pa-att-ata-pizza_1042389.svd|title=Svenska dagbladet: Pizza statistics according to AC Nielsen|work=SvD.se|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By far the most popular is the frozen pizza [[Grandiosa]], every other pizza sold, frozen or fresh is a Pizza Grandiosa. Since its start in 1980 the Grandiosa has been part of Norwegian modern culture and trends, going so far to be unofficial called &quot;The national dish of Norway&quot;.

Norway also has a traditional home-made pizza called &quot;lørdagspizza&quot; (literally translates to &quot;Saturday pizza&quot;). The dough is shaped to the pan (usually rectangular), then a mix of minced meat and tomato sauce follows. Finally it is gratinated with a generous amount of cheese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.side2.no/foreldre/19-ting-barna-dine-aldri-vil-forsta/8483346.html|title=19 ting barna dine aldri vil forstå|last=Aabel|first=Suzanne|work=Side2|access-date=2017-06-14|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godt.no/oppskrift/1430/geir-skeies-langpannepizza-med-pizzasalat|title=Godt.no - Finn noe godt å spise|website=Godt.no|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
[[File:Pizza bella vista.jpg|thumb|Pizza prepared in [[Swedish cuisine|Sweden]]]]

Pizza arrived in [[Sweden]] with Italian guest workers and became popular around 1970. Swedish pizza is mainly of the Neapolitan type and most pizzerias in Sweden have Margherita, Capricciosa and Quattro Stagioni pizzas at the top of the menu, although with altered recipes. For example, a Swedish Margherita uses Swedish hard cheese instead of mozzarella and dried [[oregano]] instead of fresh basil. The Swedish pizza has been developed with lots of innovations and styles, creating a tradition distinct from the Italian one, although some names may overlap. Occasionally pizzerias offer &quot;Italian pizza&quot; imitating Italian recipes in addition to the Swedish ones.

A typical Swedish pizzeria offers 40-50 different named varieties on the menu, even up to 100, and personal modifications are allowed. Also, many pizzerias also serve [[salad]]s, [[lasagne]], [[kebab]] and [[hamburger]]s, especially if there is a facility to sit and eat. Italian style restaurants often combine a restaurant menu with a pizza menu.

Some popular varieties common in most of Sweden, mostly with the same name, all having tomato sauce and cheese to start with and additional toppings:
* Africana: ham/beef/chicken, banana, pineapple, onion, [[curry powder]]
* Bolognese: [[Ground meat|minced]] meat, onion, (fresh tomato)
* Calzone (folded): ham
* Capricciosa: [[mushroom]]s, [[ham]]
* Ciao-ciao (folded): beef, [[garlic]], (onion)
* Frutti di mare: [[tuna]], shrimp, mussels
* Hawaii: ham, pineapple
* Kebabpizza: [[Doner kebab#Sweden|döner kebab]], onion, green [[peperoncini]], (kebab sauce poured over after baking)
* Marinara: shrimp, mussels
* Mexicana: various recipes with minced beef, [[jalapeño]]s, onion, spicy sauce and other spicy ingredients
* Napolitana: [[anchovies]], [[olive]]s, capers
* Quattro Stagioni: ham, [[shrimp]], ([[mussel]]s), mushrooms, [[artichoke]]
* Vegetariana: mushrooms, onion, ([[pineapple]]), ([[artichoke]]s), ([[asparagus]]), ([[red bell pepper]])
* other varieties with [[fillet (cut)|filet]] of beef or pork and [[béarnaise sauce]] and onion

Perhaps the most extreme pizza sort heard of in Sweden is the Calskrove or Calzskrove (a portmanteau of [[calzone]] and &quot;skrovmål&quot; meaning &quot;big meal&quot; but also Northern slang for &quot;hamburger meal&quot;), sold at some pizzerias in northern Sweden, a complete meal of a 150 or 250 grams hamburger with bread and all regular toppings, and chips (french fries), baked into a regular Calzone with ham as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsterpizzan|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/matvin/article11029191.ab|work=Aftonbladet|accessdate=3 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106085616/http://www.aftonbladet.se/matvin/article11029191.ab|archivedate=6 January 2016|language=Swedish|date=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular types of pizza in Sweden since the 1990s is kebab-pizza, and a song in the Swedish [[Melodifestivalen]] 2008 was &quot;Kebabpizza [[slivovitz]]a&quot;. The invention is most likely the result of the common tendency of pizza bakers to create their own flagship compositions and novel flavors, using whatever might be available in their kitchen. In recent years one can find pizza with fresh lettuce or chips ([[French fries]]) put on top after baking. The amount of topping compared to the crust is rather high by international standards.

The typical side order with Swedish pizza is a free &quot;pizza salad&quot;. 1969 Giuseppe &quot;Peppino&quot; Sperandio opened &quot;Pizzeria Piazza Opera&quot;, one of the first restaurants only serving pizza in Stockholm, Sweden. Sperandio was born in northeast Italy where a cabbage salad called &quot;kupus salata&quot; was a very common dish, from bordering country Croatia. This salad from his childhood, was offered as a free side dish. Eaten, while waiting for the pizza to be baked. Sperandio became Stockholm's pizza king and had during his hey day more than 30 pizza restaurants. Today this Balkan salad (renamed to pizza salad), is as Swedish as the Dala horse.
The pizza salad is made with shredded [[cabbage]], coarse [[Black pepper|pepper]] and sometimes [[red bell pepper]], slightly pickled ([[Fermentation (food)|fermented]]) in [[vinaigrette]] for a few days.

In general, Swedish pizzerias are private [[Business|enterprises]] and not [[franchising|franchise]], often owned as a family business by immigrants, but very seldom Italians. Of international [[restaurant chain]]s only [[Pizza Hut]] is well established, although [[Vapiano]] has a few restaurants in [[Stockholm]] and [[Domino's]] have been trying to establish itself in southern Sweden since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dominos.se/|title=Dominos.se (Swedish)|accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many pizzerias offer affordable (about 1-2 € total, or free with large order) home delivery in less than 30 minutes and many are connected to an on-line ordering service. The take-away price of one standard size (30&amp;nbsp;cm) pizza is 5 to 8 € depending on topping, about the double for a &quot;family pizza&quot; of double size (weight), and about the half for a &quot;children's pizza&quot; (mostly served in restaurants). Pizza has become a staple food in Sweden (1,1&amp;nbsp;kg/year), although most people prepare their own food, as home cooking skills generally are good, and is largely considered as an acceptable occasional fast food alternative to a proper meal.

=== United Kingdom ===
Since the 1980s, a wide variety of pizzas ranging from fairly authentic Italian to American style to the mass-processed varieties are widely available and pizzas are also commonly made at home with children using local substitutions such as [[bacon]] for [[prosciutto]] and [[cheddar cheese|cheddar]] for [[mozzarella]]. Dough bases vary widely from homemade [[scone]] doughs to thin Roman-style and thick American stuffed-crust types. The typical British high-street now has a variety of international Italian- and American-style pizza chains, including homegrown chains [[PizzaExpress]], [[Strada]] and [[Prezzo]] as well as Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's alongside much more authentic independent Italian-run restaurants with wood-fired ovens particularly in large cities such as London. Unique spicy varieties enjoy some popularity, including [[Chicken tikka masala]] or other curry toppings, chilli pizzas and a typical mid-range restaurant or takeaway will usually have versions of such standard &quot;Italian-American&quot; combinations as 'Hawaiian' (ham and pineapple); 'Peperroni' (spicy salami) and 'Meat Feast' (a mix of meats and salami) and a 'Vegeteriana' options. Non-Italian varieties are common too, for example, [[lahmacun]] called 'Turkish pizzas', or Alsatian '[[Tarte flambée|Flammkuchen]]'. In some parts of [[Scotland]] you can get a [[deep-fried pizza]] from [[fish and chips|Fish and Chip]] shops. A frozen pizza, whole or half, dipped in batter and deep fried. It is usually served with in the same manner as any other fried item from these shops.

===Iceland===
Iceland has all of the typical pizza toppings you would expect like pepperoni and sausage but also have some unique ones. A pizza topping that is found in Iceland that may not be found elsewhere would be bananas. Bananas are used as toppings across the country showing how they have created their own version of an Italian classic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thornhill, Jan 2010&quot;/&gt;

== Middle East ==
[[File:Israeli Pizza w Corn BRiboa 3124.jpg|thumb|Pizza with corn and [[za'atar]] in [[Kfar Saba]], [[Israel]]]]

=== Israel ===
Many [[Israel]]i and American pizza stores and chains, including Pizza Hut and [[Sbarro]], have both [[kashrut|kosher]] and non-kosher locations.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Kosher locations either have no meat or use imitation meat because of the Jewish religious dietary prohibition against mixing meat with dairy products, such as cheese. Kosher pizza locations must also close during the holiday of [[Passover]], when no [[leavened bread]] is allowed in kosher locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klingbail |first=Sivan |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/pizza-hut-revamps-to-survive-1.157518 |title=Pizza Hut revamps to survive |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2005-05-03 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Israeli pizza differs from pizza in other countries because of the very large portions of vegetable toppings such as mushrooms or onions, and some unusual toppings, like corn or [[Strained yogurt|labane]], and middle-Eastern spices, such as [[za'atar]]. Like most foods in Israel, pizza choices reflect multiple cultures.

=== Turkey ===
Pizza establishments in [[Turkey]] are a mixture of local restaurants, local chains (e.g. Pizza Max), and international chains like [[Pizza Hut]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Little Caesars]], and [[Sbarro]]. While most combinations of toppings reflect common ingredients found in the US and Italy, there are additional ingredients available that cater to traditional tastes as well, such as minced beef, spicy [[Sucuk]] sausage, cured meats like [[Pastırma]], cheeses like [[Kaşar]] and [[Beyaz peynir|Beyaz]], and local olives and herbs. With the exception of some restaurants, pork products like ham and bacon are not available, which are substituted with beef, chicken, or lamb equivalents.

Pizza has several equivalent or similar dishes in traditional [[Turkish cuisine]], such as Black-Sea-style or Bafra-style [[Pita|Pide]] and [[Lahmacun]], which adds to the popularity of the dish across Turkey.

== North America ==

=== Mexico ===

'''Mexican pizza''' is a pizza made with ingredients typical of [[Mexican cuisine]]. The usual toppings that can be found throughout Mexico are [[chorizo]], [[jalapeño]] pepper slices, grilled or fried onions, tomato, [[chile]], [[shrimp]], [[avocado]], and sometimes beef, [[bell peppers]], [[tripas]] or [[scallop]]. This pizza has the usual [[marinara sauce]] or [[Alfredo sauce|white sauce]] and [[mozzarella cheese]]. Variations, substituting [[pepper jack cheese]] or [[Oaxaca cheese]] for mozzarella, are also popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCF4hP1EmrsC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=mexican+pizza&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9NPVUZPyOOf0iQKO6oGgDA&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ |title=Fast Food Fix: 75+ Amazing Recipe Makeovers of Your Fast Food Restaurant Favorites | first = Devin | last = Alexander |publisher= |date=2006-04-18 |pages=164–165|accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the first pizza establishment in the [[United States]] was opened in [[New York City|New York's]] [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Eric |last=Asimov |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/10/dining/new-york-pizza-the-real-thing-makes-a-comeback.html |title=New York Pizza, the Real Thing, Makes a Comeback |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 10, 1998 |accessdate=2006-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the influx of Italian immigrants, the U.S. has developed regional forms of pizza, some bearing only a casual resemblance to the Italian original. [[Chicago]] has its own style of a [[Chicago deep dish pizza|deep-dish pizza]] and New York City's style of pizza are well-known. [[New York-style pizza]] refers to the thin crust pizza popular in the states of New York, [[New Jersey]], and [[Connecticut]].  [[Philadelphia]] provides sauce on top of the cheese; [[St. Louis]] and other Midwest pizzas use thin crusts and rectangular slices in its [[St. Louis-style pizza|local pizzas]]. [[Detroit-style pizza]] is a square pizza that has a thick deep-dish crisp crust, and is generally served with the sauce on top of the cheese. The square shape is the result of an early tradition of using metal trays originally meant to hold small parts in factories. The [[jumbo slice]] is an oversized [[New York-style pizza]] sold by the slice to go, especially in the [[Adams Morgan]] neighborhood in Washington, D.C. The [[Clam pie#White clam pie|white clam pie]] is a pizza variety that originated at the [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana]] restaurant in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Barrett | first=L. | last2=Abate | first2=L. | last3=Caporuscio | first3=R. | last4=Bello | first4=M. | last5=Bruno | first5=S. | title=Pizza, A Slice of American History | publisher=Voyageur Press | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-7603-4560-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPCuBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58 | page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===

The usual Italian varieties are available, though more common is the style popular in the U.S., with more and richer toppings than Italian style. A common unique type is the '''Aussie''', '''Australian''' or '''Australiana''', which has the usual tomato base or a seasoned base and mozzarella cheese with options of chicken, ham, bacon and egg (seen as quintessentially Australian breakfast fare). Pizzas with seafood such as [[prawns]] are also popular. In the 1980s some [[Australian]] pizza shops and restaurants began selling &quot;gourmet pizzas&quot;, that is, pizzas with more expensive ingredients such as salmon, dill, [[bocconcini]], tiger prawns, or unconventional toppings such as [[kangaroo meat]], [[emu]] and [[crocodile]]. &quot;Wood-fired pizzas&quot;, that is, those cooked in a ceramic oven heated by [[wood fuel]], are well-regarded.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Franchised chains coexists with independent pizzerias, Middle-Eastern bakeries and kebabs shops.

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand's first dedicated pizza outlet was [[1974 in New Zealand#Events|opened]] by Pizza Hut in New Lynn in 1974, with Dominos following. One notable indigenous chain is [[Hell Pizza]] established in 1996 - which now has outlets worldwide - distinguishing itself by often-controversial marketing and using only free-range ingredients. Independent restaurants are common.

New Zealand has no rules for pizza construction, leading to an eclectic and varied approach to toppings. Gourmet and &quot;wild&quot; ingredients are often used, and New Zealanders are apt to push the boundaries of what a pizza can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anything Goes : Pizza In New Zealand|url=https://www.dinein.co.nz/cms/anything-goes-pizza-in-new-zealand/|website=Dine In|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South America ==

=== Argentina ===

Standard Argentine pizza has a thicker crust than traditional Italian style pizza and includes more cheese. Pizza is made with very thin, and sometimes thick, high-rising [[dough]]s, with or without [[cheese]], cooked in the [[oven]] or ''a la piedra'' (on a [[stone oven]]), and stuffed with numerous ingredients -— is a dish which can be found in nearly every corner of the  country. [[Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario]], and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] also serve it with [[fainá]], which is a chick pea-flour dough placed over the piece of pizza. People say that what makes the Argentine pizza unique is the blending of Italian and Spanish cultures. At the turn of the 19th century, immigrants from [[Naples]] and [[Genoa]] opened the first pizza bars, though Spanish residents subsequently owned most of the pizza businesses.
Another very popular kind is the fugazza, which consists in a regular pizza crust topped with onions, ground black pepper, olive oil and mozzarella cheese (in this case it is called fugazzeta).

=== Brazil ===
[[File:Chocolate Pizza.JPG|thumb|[[Chocolate pizza]] served as a dessert at a restaurant in [[Brazil]]]]

[[São Paulo]] has 6,000 pizza establishments and 1.4&amp;nbsp;million pizzas are consumed daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indexet.gazetamercantil.com.br/arquivo/2007/07/10/330/Capital-da-pizza,-sabores-para-todos.html |title=Capital da pizza, sabores para todos |publisher= Gazeta Mercantil |date= |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the first [[Brazil]]ian pizzas were baked in the Brás district of São Paulo in the late part of the 19th century. Until the 1940s, almost only found in the Italian communities around the country. Since then, pizza became increasingly popular among the rest of the population. The most traditional pizzerias are still found in the Italian neighborhoods, such as Bexiga (official name: Bela Vista). Both Neapolitan (thick crust) and Roman (thin crust) varieties are common in Brazil, with traditional versions using tomato sauce and mozzarella as a base. Brazilian pizza in general, though, tends to have less tomato sauce than the authentic (Italian) pizza, or uses slices of tomato in place of sauce. Brazilian pizzerias offer also Brazilian variants such as &quot;pizza com [[catupiry]]&quot;. July 10 is &quot;Pizza Day&quot; in São Paulo, marking the final day of an annual competition among &quot;pizzaiolos&quot;. In Brazil, pizza quatro queijos (''pizza quattro formaggi'') uses [[mozzarella]], [[provolone]], [[parmesan]] and [[gorgonzola]], and there is also a variety with five cheeses, which adds [[catupiry]].

=== Colombia ===

&quot;[[Hawaiian pizza]]&quot; is popular in Colombia.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The pizza is topped with ham and pineapple.

The presence of pizza [[restaurant chain]]s has contributed to a significant increase in [[pizza]] consumption in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;French Crabbe 2010&quot;/&gt; This also had an effect of introducing [[cheese]] as a culinary ingredient and everyday food in China, which was relatively uncommon in Chinese cuisine prior to the emergence of pizza chains.&lt;ref name=&quot;French Crabbe 2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts 2016&quot;/&gt; [[Pizza Hut]] opened its first store in China in 1990,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 2011&quot;/&gt; and several pizza restaurant chains exist in China today.

===Early history===
[[Pizza Hut]] opened its first store in China in 1990, and Pizza Hut and [[Domino's Pizza]] both expanded in the Chinese market in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan Zakkour 2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 2016&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts 2016&quot;/&gt; Prior to entering the market, Pizza Hut performed market analysis and research into consumer food preferences, tastes, and dining habits, whereas Domino's simply entered the market providing their standard fare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan Zakkour 2014&quot;/&gt; With its planning and research, Pizza Hut was successful in its endeavors, opening over 1,300 stores in the country, whereas Domino's was rather unsuccessful, with under 40 stores in China in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan Zakkour 2014&quot;/&gt; At the time, Domino's provided the company's [[pizza delivery|delivery]] guarantee of thirty minutes or less, but did not take into account many Chinese cities' heavy vehicle traffic and [[gridlock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan Zakkour 2014&quot;/&gt; Domino's lack of success in the Chinese market has also been attributed to the chain's fare lacking appeal to Chinese consumers, not having sit-down restaurants (Domino's stores were take-out and delivery only), and the large size of the company's pizzas, which made them difficult for consumers to eat while walking or hanging out on the street.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan Zakkour 2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sozzi 2015&quot;/&gt;

Prior to establishing restaurants in China, [[Pizza Hut]] management was told by experts that many Chinese consumers do not like cheese and [[Lactose_intolerance#Epidemiology|may not be able to digest it]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahlstrom Bruton 2009&quot;/&gt;{{efn|&quot;... cheese is not traditionally a part of the Chinese diet, with many Chinese being [[Lactose intolerance|lactose-intolerant]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sozzi 2015&quot;/&gt;}} The company's management was also informed that tomato is not a culinary ingredient in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahlstrom Bruton 2009&quot;/&gt; Per these factors, Pizza Hut was warned that Chinese consumers would not eat pizza.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahlstrom Bruton 2009&quot;/&gt; In response to this, Pizza Hut modified their pizza recipes, using less tomato sauce and cheese and including indigenous ingredients that were agreeable to Chinese consumers, such as tuna, crab sticks, soy sauce, chicken and corn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahlstrom Bruton 2009&quot;/&gt; The company also created new pizzas for the Chinese market, such as the Homemade Sweet and Creamy, which resembles apple turnovers, and the [[Thousand Island dressing]] pizza, which lacked tomato sauce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahlstrom Bruton 2009&quot;/&gt; As of 2014, Pizza Hut had over 1,300 stores in China, with a particularly strong presence in [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan Zakkour 2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yu 2012 p. 51&quot;/&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Italy:

'''[[Italy]]''' &amp;ndash; [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] in South-Central [[Europe]], located primarily upon the [[Italian Peninsula]]. It is where [[Ancient Rome]] originated as a small agricultural community about the 8th century BC, which spread over the course of centuries into the colossal [[Roman empire]], encompassing the whole [[Mediterranean Sea]] and merging the [[Ancient Greek]] and Roman cultures into one civilization.  This civilization was so influential that parts of it survive in modern [[law]], [[Central Administration|administration]], [[philosophy]] and [[arts]], providing the groundwork that the [[Western world]] is based upon.

Due to cultural, political and historical reasons, Italy is a [[Western Europe]]an country.&lt;/ref&gt; Located in the heart of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Italy shares [[open borders|open land borders]] with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of {{convert|301338|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and has a largely [[Temperate climate|temperate seasonal]] and [[Mediterranean climate]]. With around 61 million inhabitants it is the [[List of European Union member states by population|fourth most populous EU member state]].

Since [[classical antiquity|classical times]], many ancient peoples inhabited Italy. The [[Italic tribe]] known as the [[Latins]] formed the [[Roman Kingdom]], which eventually became a [[Roman Republic|republic]] that [[Roman conquest of Italy|conquered]] and [[Romanization (cultural)|assimilated]] other nearby civilisations. Ultimately the [[Roman Empire]] emerged as the dominant power in the [[Mediterranean basin]] and became the leading cultural, political and religious [[caput mundi|centre]] of [[Western world|Western civilisation]]. The [[legacy of the Roman Empire]] is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of [[civilian law]], [[republican government]]s, Christianity and the [[Latin script]]. During the [[Early Middle Ages]], Italy suffered [[Collapse of the Roman Empire|sociopolitical collapse]] amid calamitous [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]], but by the 11th century, numerous rival [[Italian city-states|city-states]] and [[maritime republics]] rose to great prosperity through shipping, commerce and banking, laying down the groundwork for modern capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sée|first=Henri|title=Modern Capitalism Its Origin and Evolution|url=http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|work=University of Rennes|publisher=Batoche Books|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]], [[Renaissance science|science]], [[Renaissance exploration|exploration]] and [[Renaissance art|art]]. Italian culture flourished at this time, producing famous scholars, artists and [[polymaths]]. Since Middle Age, Italian explorers discovered new routes to the Far East and the [[New World]], helping to usher in the European [[Age of Discovery]].

== Etymology ==
{{anchor|Etymology}}
{{Main article|Name of Italy}}
The assumptions on the etymology of the name &quot;Italia&quot; are very numerous and the corpus of the solutions proposed by historians and linguists is very wide.&lt;ref name= Manco&gt;Alberto Manco, ''Italia. Disegno storico-linguistico'', 2009, [[Napoli]], L'Orientale, {{ISBN|978-88-95044-62-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one of the more common explanations, the term ''[[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italia]]'', from {{lang-lat|Italia}},&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Latin Dictionary|OLD]], p. 974: &quot;first syll. naturally short (cf. [[Quintilian|Quint.]]''Inst.''1.5.18), and so scanned in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;[[Gaius Lucilius|Lucil.]]&lt;/span&gt;825, but in dactylic verse lengthened ''metri gratia''.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; was borrowed through [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] from the [[Oscan language|Oscan]] ''Víteliú'', meaning &quot;land of young cattle&quot; (''cf.'' [[Latin|Lat]] ''vitulus'' &quot;calf&quot;, [[Umbrian language|Umb]] ''vitlo'' &quot;calf&quot;)&lt;!-- and named for the god of cattle, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory and D.Q. Adams, ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'' (London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The bull was a symbol of the southern Italic tribes and was often depicted goring the Roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free Italy during the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]]. Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after [[Italus]],&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
''Roman Antiquities'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html 1.35], on LacusCurtius&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned also by [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D7%3Asection%3D1329b#note-link2 7.1329b], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+6.2.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 6.2.4], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Italia'' originally applied only to a part of what is now [[Southern Italy]] – according to [[Antiochus of Syracuse]], the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula (modern [[Calabria]]: province of [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]], and part of the provinces of [[Catanzaro]] and [[Vibo Valentia]]). But by his time [[Oenotria]] and Italy had become synonymous, and the name also applied to most of [[Lucania]] as well. The Greeks gradually came to apply the name &quot;Italia&quot; to a larger region, but it was during the reign of [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Augustus]] (end of the 1st century BC) that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula until the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;Pallottino, M., ''History of Earliest Italy'', trans.

[[Ancient Rome|Rome]], a settlement around a ford on the river [[Tiber]] conventionally [[Founding of Rome|founded]] in 753 BC, was ruled for a period of 244 years by a [[Roman Kingdom|monarchical]] system, initially with sovereigns of [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] and [[Sabines|Sabine]] origin, later by [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] kings. The tradition handed down seven kings: [[Romulus]], [[Numa Pompilius]], [[Tullus Hostilius]], [[Ancus Marcius]], [[Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]] and [[Tarquinius Superbus]]. In 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city and established an [[Roman Republic|oligarchic republic]].

In the wake of [[Julius Caesar]]'s rise and [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|death]] in the first century B.C., Rome grew over the course of centuries into a massive [[Roman empire|empire]] stretching from [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britain]] to the borders of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Persia]], and engulfing the whole [[Mediterranean]] basin, in which Greek and Roman and many other cultures merged into a unique [[Greco-Roman world|civilisation]]. The long and triumphant reign of its first emperor, [[Augustus]], began a golden age of peace and prosperity.

The Roman Empire was among the most powerful economic, cultural, political and military forces in the world of its time. It was one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in world history]]. At its height under [[Trajan]], it covered 5 million square kilometres.&lt;ref name=&quot;size&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Social Science History |title=Size and Duration of Empires: Growth-Decline Curves, 600 B.C. to 600 A.D |first=Rein |last=Taagepera |volume=3 |issue=3/4 |year=1979 |page=125|doi=10.2307/1170959|jstor=1170959|publisher=Duke University Press |authorlink=Rein Taagepera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cliodynamics.info&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Adams|first2=Jonathan M.|last3=Hall|first3=Thomas D | title = East-West Orientation of Historical Empires | journal = Journal of world-systems research|date=2006 |volume=12|issue=2 |page=222|url = http://peterturchin.com/PDF/Turchin_Adams_Hall_2006.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2016 |issn= 1076-156X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman [[Legacy of the Roman Empire|legacy]] has deeply influenced the Western civilisation, shaping most of the modern world; among the many legacies of Roman dominance are the widespread use of the [[Romance languages]] derived from Latin, the [[Roman numerals|numerical system]], the modern Western [[Latin alphabet|alphabet]] and [[Western calendar|calendar]], and the emergence of Christianity as a major world religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richard|first=Carl J.|title=Why we're all Romans : the Roman contribution to the western world|year=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0-7425-6779-6|pages=xi–xv|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a slow [[Decline of the Roman Empire|decline]] since the third century AD, the Empire split in two in 395 AD. The [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], under the pressure of the [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]], eventually dissolved in 476 AD, when its [[Romulus Augustulus|last Emperor]] was deposed by the Germanic chief [[Odoacer]], while the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] half of the Empire survived for another thousand years.

The Lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the [[Frankish Empire]] by [[Charlemagne]] in the late 8th century. The Franks also helped the formation of the [[Papal States]] in central Italy. Until the 13th century, Italian politics was dominated by the relations between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and the Papacy, with most of the Italian city-states siding for the former ([[Ghibellines]]) or for the latter ([[Guelphs]]) from momentary convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolan|first=Cathal J.|title=The age of wars of religion, 1000–1650 : an encyclopedia of global warfare and civilization|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport (Connecticut)|isbn=0-313-33045-X|page=360|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Italy 1494.svg|thumb|left|200px|Italian states before the beginning of the [[Italian Wars]] in 1494.]]

In the 14th and 15th centuries, northern-central Italy was divided into a number of warring [[Italian city-states|city-states]], the rest of the peninsula being occupied by the larger Papal States and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], referred to here as Naples. Though many of these city-states were often formally subordinate to foreign rulers, as in the case of the [[Duchy of Milan]], which was officially a [[constituent state]] of the mainly Germanic [[Holy Roman Empire]], the city-states generally managed to maintain de facto independence from the foreign sovereigns that had seized Italian lands following the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|collapse]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The strongest among these city-states gradually absorbed the surrounding territories giving birth to the [[Signoria|Signorie]], regional states often led by merchant families which founded local dynasties. War between the city-states was endemic, and primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as ''[[Condottiere|condottieri]]'', bands of soldiers drawn from around Europe, especially Germany and Switzerland, led largely by Italian captains.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Decades of fighting eventually saw [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] emerged as the dominant players that agreed to the [[Peace of Lodi]] in 1454, which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries. This peace would hold for the next forty years.

The [[Renaissance]], a period of vigorous revival of the arts and culture, originated in Italy thanks to a number of factors, as the great wealth accumulated by merchant cities, the [[patronage]] of its dominant families,&lt;ref name=&quot;strathern&quot;&gt;Strathern, Paul ''The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and the migration of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek scholars]] and texts to Italy following the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] at the hands of the [[Ottoman Turks]].&lt;ref name=Britannica1&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Renaissance'', 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;Har, Michael H.

The [[Italian Renaissance]] peaked in the mid-16th century as foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the [[Italian Wars]].

The [[Medici]] became the leading family of [[Florence]] and fostered and inspired the birth of the Italian Renaissance,&lt;ref name=&quot;strathern&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006]. {{ISBN|5-85050-825-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with other families of Italy, such as the [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] and [[Sforza]] of [[Milan]], the [[House of Este|Este]] of [[Ferrara]], and the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] of [[Mantua]]. Greatest artists like [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Brunelleschi]], [[Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Giotto]], [[Donatello]], [[Titian]] and [[Raphael]] produced inspired works – their paintwork was more realistic-looking than had been created by Medieval artists and their marble statues rivalled and sometimes surpassed those of [[Classical Antiquity]]. Humanist historian [[Leonardo Bruni]] also split the history in the antiquity, Middle Ages and modern period.&lt;ref name=hankins-2001&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/results-list.php?collection=1389 |title=History of the Florentine People | volume=1 | author1=Leonardo Bruni|author2=James Hankins|date=9 October 2010 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Boston }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ideas and ideals of the Renaissance soon spread into [[Northern Renaissance|Northern Europe]], [[French Renaissance|France]], [[English Renaissance|England]] and much of Europe. In the meantime, the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovery of the Americas]], the new routes to Asia discovered by the Portuguese and the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], all factors which eroded the traditional Italian dominance in trade with the East, caused a long economic decline in the peninsula.

Following the [[Italian Wars]] (1494 to 1559), ignited by the rivalry between France and Spain, the city-states gradually lost their independence and came under foreign domination, first under [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] (1559 to 1713) and then [[Habsburg Austria|Austria]] (1713 to 1796). In 1629–1631, a new outburst of [[Italian plague of 1629–31|plague]] claimed about 14% of Italy's population.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Julius Beloch, ''Bevölkerungsgeschichte Italiens'', volume 3, pp. 359–360.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as the Spanish Empire started to [[The decline of Hapsburg Spain in the seventeenth century|decline]] in the 17th century, so did its possessions in Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and Milan.

In the 18th century, as a result of the [[War of Spanish Succession]], [[Empire of Austria|Austria]] replaced Spain as the dominant foreign power, while the [[House of Savoy]] emerged as a regional power expanding to [[Piedmont]] and [[Sardinia]]. In the same century, the two-century long decline was interrupted by the economic and state reforms pursued in several states by the ruling élites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galasso|first=Giuseppe|title=Storia d'Italia 1: I caratteri originali|year=1972|publisher=Einaudi| location=Turin|pages=509–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], northern-central Italy was invaded and reorganised as a new [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], a [[client state]] of the [[Napoleonic France|French Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte, &quot;The Economy of the Empire in Italy: Instructions from Napoleon to Eugène, Viceroy of Italy,&quot; ''Exploring the European Past: Texts &amp; Images'', Second Edition, ed.

The 1814 [[Congress of Vienna]] restored the situation of the late 18th century, but the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] could not be eradicated, and soon re-surfaced during the [[political revolution|political upheavals]] that characterised the first part of the 19th century.

=== Italian unification ===
{{Main article|Italian unification|Kingdom of Italy|Military history of Italy during World War I}}
[[File:Italian-unification.gif|thumb|Animated map of the Italian unification, from 1829 to 1871]]

The birth of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the [[House of Savoy]] to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire [[Italian Peninsula]]. In the context of the [[revolutions of 1848|1848 liberal revolutions]] that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful [[First Italian War of Independence|war]] was declared on [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]. The [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] again attacked the Austrian Empire in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] of 1859, with the aid of [[Second French Empire|France]], resulting in liberating [[Lombardy]].
[[File:Giuseppe Garibaldi (1866).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], considered one of the greatest generals of modern times and one of Italy's &quot;fathers of the fatherland&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWK7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Garibaldi+one+of+the+greatest+generals+of+modern+time&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIxJm7j9HVAhXHC8AKHU0DA5MQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Garibaldi+one+of+the+greatest+generals+of+modern+time&amp;f=false|title=Scholar and Patriot|publisher=Manchester University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; commanded and fought in many military campaigns that led eventually to the Italian unification, and is known as the ''Hero of the Two Worlds''&lt;ref name=&quot;Garibaldi on Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/225978/Giuseppe-Garibaldi | title=Giuseppe Garibaldi (Italian revolutionary) | accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1860–1861, general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily,&lt;ref&gt;Mack Smith, Denis (1997). ''Modern Italy; A Political History''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|0-472-10895-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the Sardinian government led by the [[Camillo Benso|Count of Cavour]] to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861. In 1866, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annex [[Veneto|Venetia]]. Finally, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by [[Capture of Rome|taking over the Papal States]].

The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] of 1848, was extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. As [[Northern Italy]] quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad, while the [[Italian Socialist Party]] constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment. Starting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing [[Italian Somalia|Somalia]], [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and later [[Italian Libya|Libya]] and the [[Italian Dodecanese|Dodecanese]] under its rule.&lt;ref&gt;(Bosworth (2005), pp. 49.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy, nominally allied with the [[German Empire]] and the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], in 1915 joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] into the war with a [[Treaty of London (1915)|promise]] of substantial territorial gains, that included western [[Inner Carniola]], former [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Dalmatia]] as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army get struck in a long [[trench warfare|attrition war]] in the Alps, making little progress and suffering very heavy losses. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]. The Italian victory&lt;ref&gt;Burgwyn, H.

During the war, more than 650,000 Italian soldiers and as many civilians died&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Salute pubblica in Italia durante e dopo la Guerra|last=Mortara|first=G|year=1925|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the kingdom went to the brink of bankruptcy. Under the Peace Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Saint-Germain]], [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo]] and [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Rome]], Italy obtained most of the promised territories, but not Dalmatia (except [[Zadar|Zara]]), allowing nationalists to define the victory as &quot;[[Mutilated victory|mutilated]]&quot;. Moreover, Italy annexed the Hungarian harbour of [[Rijeka|Fiume]], that was not part of territories promised at London but [[Impresa di Fiume|had been occupied]] after the end of the war by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].

=== Fascist regime ===
{{Main article|Italian Fascism|Military history of Italy during World War II}}
[[File:Benito Mussolini colored.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benito Mussolini]], ''[[duce]]'' of [[Fascist Italian|Fascist Italy]]]]
The [[Biennio Rosso|socialist agitations]] that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party attempted a [[coup d'état|coup]] (the &quot;[[March on Rome]]&quot;) which failed but at the last minute, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a [[Totalitarianism|dictatorship]]. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Francoist Spain]].

In 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]; Italy [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish civil war]]. In 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|annexed Albania]], a ''de facto'' protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. After initially advancing in [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|British Somaliland]] and [[Italian invasion of Egypt|Egypt]], the Italians were defeated in East Africa, the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]], [[Italian participation in the Eastern Front|Russia]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]].

An [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] began in July 1943, leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime and the fall of Mussolini on [[25 Luglio|25 July]]. On 8 September, Italy [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|surrendered]]. The Germans helped by the Italian fascists shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy. The country remained a [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battlefield]] for the rest of the war, as the Allies were slowly moving up from the south.

In the north, the Germans set up the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] with Mussolini installed as leader. The post-armistice period saw the rise of a large [[anti-fascist]] [[resistance movement]], the ''[[Resistenza]]''. In late April 1945, with total defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Marino|last=Viganò|title=Un'analisi accurata della presunta fuga in Svizzera|journal=Nuova Storia Contemporanea|volume=3|year=2001|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was captured and [[Death of Benito Mussolini|summarly executed]] near [[Lake Como]] by Italian partisans.

The [[Constitution of Italy|Republican Constitution]] was approved on 1 January 1948. Under the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Treaty of Peace with Italy]] of 1947, most of [[Julian March]] was lost to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and, later, the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] was divided between the two states. Italy also lost all its colonial possessions, formally ending the [[Italian Empire]].

Fears in the Italian electorate of a possible Communist takeover proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on [[Italian general election, 1948|18 April 1948]], when the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], under the leadership of [[Alcide De Gasperi]], obtained a landslide victory. Consequently, in 1949 Italy became a member of [[NATO]]. The [[Marshall Plan]] helped to revive the Italian economy which, until the late 1960s, enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the &quot;[[Italian economic miracle|Economic Miracle]]&quot;. In 1957, Italy was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), which became the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993.

From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the country experienced the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]], a period characterised by economic crisis (especially after the [[1973 oil crisis]]), widespread social conflicts and terrorist massacres carried out by opposing extremist groups, with the alleged involvement of US and Soviet intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi (Parliamentary investigative commission on terrorism in Italy and the failure to identify the perpetrators) | year=1995 | accessdate=2 May 2006 | url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/report_ital_senate.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060819211212/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/report_ital_senate.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 19 August 2006|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Docs&quot;&gt;{{en icon}} / {{it icon}} / {{fr icon}} /{{de icon}} {{cite web|title=Secret Warfare: Operation Gladio and NATO's Stay-Behind Armies |accessdate=2 May 2006 |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology / International Relation and Security Network |url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/collections/coll_gladio.htm#Documents |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425182721/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/collections/coll_gladio.htm |archivedate=25 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/us.terrorism_graun_24jun2000.html |title=Clarion: Philip Willan, Guardian, 24 June 2000, page 19 |publisher=Cambridgeclarion.org |date=24 June 2000 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of the Christian Democrat leader [[Aldo Moro]] in 1978 and the [[Bologna massacre|Bologna railway station massacre]] in 1980, where 85 people died.

In the 1980s, for the first time since 1945, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers: one republican ([[Giovanni Spadolini]]) and one socialist ([[Bettino Craxi]]); the Christian Democrats remained, however, the main government party. During Craxi's government, the economy recovered and Italy became the world's fifth largest industrial nation, gaining entry into the [[G7]] Group. However, as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the GDP.

In the early 1990s, Italy faced significant challenges, as voters – disenchanted with political paralysis, massive public debt and the extensive corruption system (known as ''[[Tangentopoli]]'') uncovered by the '[[Mani pulite|Clean Hands]]' investigation – demanded radical reforms. The scandals involved all major parties, but especially those in the government coalition: the Christian Democrats, who ruled for almost 50 years, underwent a severe crisis and eventually disbanded, splitting up into several factions.&lt;ref&gt;The so-called Second Republic was born by forceps: not with a revolt of Algiers, but formally under the same Constitution, with the mere replacement of one ruling class to another: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Tovaglie pulite|journal= Mondoperaio edizione online|date=2015| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89429827}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communists reorganised as a [[social-democratic]] force. During the 1990s and the 2000s (decade), centre-right (dominated by media magnate [[Silvio Berlusconi]]) and centre-left coalitions (led by university professor [[Romano Prodi]]) alternatively governed the country.

In the late 2000s, Italy was severely hit by the [[Great Recession]]. From 2008 to 2013, the country suffered 42 months of GDP recession. The economic crisis was one of the main problems that forced Berlusconi to [[Resignation of Silvio Berlusconi|resign]] in 2011. The government of the conservative Prime Minister was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of [[Mario Monti]]. Following the [[Italian general election, 2013|2013 general election]], the Vice-Secretary of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] [[Enrico Letta]] formed a [[Letta Cabinet|new government]] at the head of a right-left [[Grand coalition (Italy)|Grand coalition]]. In 2014, challenged by the new [[List of Secretaries of the Democratic Party|Secretary]] of the PD [[Matteo Renzi]], Letta resigned and was replaced by Renzi. The new government started important constitutional reforms such as the abolition of the [[Italian Senate|Senate]] and a new electoral law. On 4 December the constitutional reform was rejected in a [[Italian constitutional referendum, 2016|referendum]] and Renzi resigned after few days on 12 December; the Foreign Affairs Minister [[Paolo Gentiloni]] was appointed new Prime Minister.

Italy was affected by the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015 as it became the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the EU. The country took in over half a million refugees, which caused great strain on the public purse and a surge in the support for far-right and euroskeptic political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Italy starts to show the strains of migrant influx|url=http://www.thelocal.it/20150519/migrant-surge-tests-italys-humanitarian-instincts|accessdate=10 January 2017|work=[[The Local]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Italy's far right jolts back from dead|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/italys-other-matteo-salvini-northern-league-politicians-media-effettosalvini/|accessdate=10 January 2017|work=[[Politico]]|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Geography of Italy}}

[[File:Italy topographic map-blank.svg|thumb|left|Topographic map of Italy]]
Italy is located in [[Southern Europe]], between latitudes [[35th parallel north|35°]] and [[47th parallel north|47° N]], and longitudes [[6th meridian east|6°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]]. To the north, Italy borders [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]], and is roughly delimited by the [[Alps|Alpine watershed]], enclosing the [[Po Valley]] and the [[Venetian Plain]]. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the two [[Mediterranean islands]] of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]], in addition to many smaller islands. The sovereign states of [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]] are [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] within Italy, while [[Campione d'Italia]] is an Italian [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] in Switzerland.

The country's total area is {{convert|301230|km²|0|abbr=out}}, of which {{convert|294020|km²|0|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|7210|km²|0|abbr=on}} is water. Including the islands, Italy has a coastline and border of {{convert|7600|km|0|abbr=off}} on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]], [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] seas ({{convert|740|km|0|abbr=on}}), and borders shared with France ({{convert|488|km|0|abbr=on}}), Austria ({{convert|430|km|0|abbr=on}}), Slovenia ({{convert|232|km|0|abbr=on}}) and Switzerland ({{convert|740|km|0|abbr=on}}). San Marino ({{convert|39|km|0|abbr=on}}) and Vatican City ({{convert|3.2|km|1|abbr=on}}), both enclaves, account for the remainder.

The [[Apennine Mountains]] form the peninsula's backbone and the [[Alps]] form most of its northern boundary, where Italy's highest point is located on [[Monte Bianco]] ({{convert|4,810|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref group=note&gt;Official French maps show the border detouring south of the main summit, and claim the highest point in Italy is Mont Blanc de Courmayeur ({{convert|4,748|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), but these are inconsistent with an 1861 convention and topographic watershed analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Po river|Po]], Italy's longest river ({{convert|652|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=off}}), flows from the Alps on the western border with France and crosses the [[Padan plain]] on its way to the [[Adriatic Sea]].

Although the country includes the Italian peninsula, adjacent islands and most of the southern Alpine basin, some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the [[Eurasia]]n continental shelf. These territories are the ''comuni'' of: [[Livigno]], [[Sexten]], [[Innichen]], [[Toblach]] (in part), [[Chiusaforte]], [[Tarvisio]], [[Graun im Vinschgau]] (in part), which are all part of the [[Danube#Drainage basin|Danube's drainage basin]], while the [[Lago di Lei|Val di Lei]] constitutes part of the [[Rhine]]'s basin and the islands of [[Lampedusa]] and [[Lampione]] are on the African [[continental shelf]].

=== Volcanology ===
{{see also|Volcanology of Italy}}
[[File:Etna eruptions April 2012.JPG|thumb|The [[Mount Etna]] is an active stratovolcano in Sicily]]
The country is situated at the meeting point of the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate, leading to considerable [[List of earthquakes in Italy|seismic]] and [[Volcanism in Italy|volcanic activity]]. There are [[List of volcanoes in Italy|14 volcanoes in Italy]], four of which are active: [[Mount Etna|Etna]] (the traditional site of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]'s smithy), [[Stromboli]], [[Vulcano]] and [[Vesuvius]]. The latter one is the only active volcano in mainland Europe and is most famous for the destruction of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculanum]] in the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption in 79 AD]]. Several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity, and there is still a large active [[caldera]], the [[Campi Flegrei]] north-west of Naples.

The high volcanic and magmatic neogenic activity is subdivided into provinces:
* Magmatic Tuscan ([[Monti Cimini]], [[Tolfa]] and [[Amiata]]);
* Magmatic Latium ([[Monti Volsini]], [[Vico nel Lazio]], [[Colli Albani]], [[Roccamonfina]]);
* Ultra-alkaline Umbrian Latium District ([[San Venanzo]], Cupaello and [[Polino]]);
[[File:Vesuvius from Monte Somma (Panorama II).jpg|thumb|[[Mount Vesuvius]], as seen from the [[Mount Somma]]]]
* Vulcanic bell (Vesuvius, [[Campi Flegrei]], [[Ischia]]);
* Windy arch and Tyrrhenian basin ([[Aeolian Islands]] and Tyrrhenian [[seamounts]]);
* African-Adriatic Avampa ([[Channel of Sicily]], [[Graham Island (Mediterranean Sea)|Graham Island]], Etna and [[Mount Vulture]]).&lt;ref name=Scro&gt;{{cite|Scrocca et al.||cidScro}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1950s, Italy was the first and only country to exploit geothermal energy to produce electricity in the [[Larderello]] area, and later in the [[Mount Amiata]] area. The high geothermal gradient that forms part of the peninsula makes potentially exploitable also other provinces: research carried out in the 1960s and 1970s identifies potential geothermal fields in Lazio and Tuscany, as well as in most volcanic islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventario delle risorse geotermiche nazionali|publisher=UNMIG|date=2011|url=http://unmig.sviluppoeconomico.gov.it/unmig/geotermia/inventario/inventario.asp|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity, while because of rising water levels, [[Venice]] has been regularly flooded throughout recent years. Waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas, as in the case of the [[Seveso disaster]]. The country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but, after the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and a [[Italian nuclear power referendum, 1987|referendum on the issue]] the nuclear programme was terminated, a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008, planning to build up to four nuclear power plants with French technology.

Deforestation, illegal building developments and poor land-management policies have led to significant erosion all over Italy's mountainous regions, leading to major ecological disasters like the 1963 [[Vajont Dam]] flood, the 1998 [[Sarno]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sicily mudslide leaves scores dead&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Nick Squires|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/6255575/Sicily-mudslide-leaves-scores-dead.html#|title=Sicily mudslide leaves scores dead|date=2 October 2009|accessdate=2 October 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2009 [[2009 Messina floods and mudslides|Messina]] [[mudslide]]s.

Italy also receives species from the [[Balkans]], [[Eurasia]], the [[Middle East]]. Italy's varied geological structure, including the [[Italian Alps|Alps]] and the [[Apennines]], Central Italian woodlands, and Southern Italian [[Garigue]] and [[Maquis shrubland]], also contribute to high climate and habitat diversity.

Italian fauna includes 4777 [[Endemism|endemic]] animal species, such as the [[Sardinian long-eared bat]], [[Corsican red deer|Sardinian red deer]], [[spectacled salamander]], [[Brown cave salamander]], [[Italian cave salamander]], [[Monte Albo cave salamander]], [[Sardinian brook salamander|Sardinian brook newt]], [[Italian newt]], [[Italian stream frog|Italian frog]], [[Apennine yellow-bellied toad]], [[Aeolian wall lizard]], [[Sicilian wall lizard]], [[Italian Aesculapian snake]], and [[Sicilian pond turtle]].

Italy is a signatory to the [[Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats]] and the [[Habitats Directive]] both affording protection to the Italian fauna and flora.

=== Climate ===
{{Main article|Climate of Italy}}
[[File:Isola di Levanzo, Sicilia, Italia.jpg|thumb|[[Southern Italy]] has a Mediterranean climate]]

Thanks to the great longitudinal extension of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous internal conformation, the climate of Italy is highly diverse. In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from [[humid subtropical]] to [[humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. In particular, the climate of the [[Po valley]] geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Rigutti, ''Meteorologia'', Giunti, p. 95, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Blair, ''Climatology: General and Regional'', Prentice Hall pages 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;

The coastal areas of [[Liguria]], [[Tuscany]] and most of the [[Southern Italy|South]] generally fit the [[Mediterranean climate]] stereotype ([[Köppen climate classification]] Csa). Conditions on peninsular coastal areas can be very different from the interior's higher ground and valleys, particularly during the winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer. Average winter temperatures vary from {{convert|0|C|lk=on}} on the Alps to
{{convert|12|C}} in Sicily, like so the average summer temperatures range from {{convert|20|C}} to over {{convert|25|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Atlas of Italy|url=http://clima.meteoam.it/atlanteClimatico.php?ling=eng|publisher=Network of the Air Force Meteorological Service|accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
{{Main article|Politics of Italy}}

Italy has been a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] since 2 June 1946, when the monarchy was abolished by a [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|constitutional referendum]]. The [[President of Italy]] (''Presidente della Repubblica''), currently [[Sergio Mattarella]] since 2015, is Italy's [[head of state]]. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the [[Parliament of Italy]] in [[joint session]]. Italy has a written democratic [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]], resulting from the work of a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] formed by the representatives of all the [[anti-fascist]] forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Howard McGaw Italy: From Fascism to the Republic (1943–1946) ''The Western Political Quarterly'' vol. 1 no. 3 (pp. 205–222), September 1948.{{jstor|442274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy has a parliamentary government based on a [[proportional representation|proportional]] voting system. The parliament is perfectly [[bicameral]]: the two houses, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] (that meets in [[Palazzo Montecitorio]]) and the [[Senate of Italy|Senate of the Republic]] (that meets in [[Palazzo Madama]]), have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), is Italy's [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic, but must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. The incumbent Prime Minister is [[Paolo Gentiloni]] of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]].

The prime minister is the President of the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]]—which holds effective executive power— and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other [[parliamentary system]]s, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the [[Parliament of Italy]].

Another difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: coordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html|title=About us - Sistema di informazione per la sicurezza della Repubblica|website=www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giuramento Mattarella Montecitorio.jpg|thumb|The [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] is the lower house of Italy.]]
A peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]]. In addition, the Italian Senate is characterised also by a small number of [[senator for life|senators for life]], appointed by the President &quot;for outstanding patriotic merits in the social, scientific, artistic or literary field&quot;. Former Presidents of the Republic are ''ex officio'' life senators.

Italy's three major political parties are the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] and the [[Five Star Movement]]. During the 2013 general election these three parties won 579 out of 630 seats available in the Chamber of Deputies and 294 out of 315 in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elezioni politiche 2013, Riepilogo Nazionale|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/speciali/2013/elezioni/risultati/politiche/static/italia.shtml|accessdate=6 December 2014|publisher=[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the remaining seats were won by a short-lived [[With Monti for Italy|electoral bloc]] formed to support the outgoing Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]], the far left party [[Left, Ecology, Freedom]] or by parties that contest elections only in one part of Italy: the [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]], the [[South Tyrolean People's Party]], [[Aosta Valley (political coalition)|Vallée d'Aoste]] and [[Great South (Italy)|Great South]]. On 15 November 2013, 58 splinter MPs from Forza Italia founded [[New Centre-Right]].

==== Law enforcement ====
{{Main article|Law enforcement in Italy}}
[[File:Alfa-Romeo159-Carabinieri-di-Roma.JPG|thumbnail|right|A [[Alfa Romeo]] vehicle of the [[Carabinieri]] corps]]

Law enforcement in Italy is provided by multiple police forces, five of which are national, Italian agencies.
The [[Polizia di Stato]] (State Police) is the civil national police of Italy. Along with patrolling, investigative and law enforcement duties, it patrols the Autostrada (Italy's Express Highway network), and oversees the security of railways, bridges and waterways. The [[Carabinieri]] is the common name for the Arma dei Carabinieri, a [[Gendarmerie]]-like military corps with police duties. They also serve as the military police for the Italian armed forces.

The [[Guardia di Finanza]], (English: Financial Guard) is a corps under the authority of the Minister of Economy and Finance, with a role as police force. The Corps is in charge of financial, economic, judiciary and public safety.
The Polizia Penitenziaria (Prison Guards, literally Penitentiary Police) operate the Italian prison system and handle the transportation of inmates.

Italy is a founding member of the [[European Community]], now the [[European Union]] (EU), and of [[NATO]]. Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and it is a member and strong supporter of a wide number of international organisations, such as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]/[[World Trade Organization]] (GATT/WTO), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Central European Initiative]]. Its recent or upcoming turns in the rotating presidency of international organisations include the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 2018, the [[G7]] in 2017 and the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EU Council]] from July to December 2014. Italy is also a recurrent [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|Non-permanent member]] of the [[UN Security Council]], the most recently in 2017.

Italy strongly supports multilateral international politics, endorsing the United Nations and its [[international security]] activities. {{As of|2013}}, Italy was deploying 5,296 troops abroad, engaged in 33 UN and NATO missions in 25 countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MISSIONI/ATTIVITA’ INTERNAZIONALI DAL 1 October 2013 AL 31 December 2013 – SITUAZIONE AL 11.12.2013|url=http://www.difesa.it/OperazioniMilitari/Documents/SIT%20ANNO%202013%20al%2011%20dicembre%202013.pdf|publisher=Italian Ministry of Defence|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in [[UNITAF|Somalia]], [[United Nations Operation in Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor|East Timor]] and provides support for NATO and UN operations in [[IFOR|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo Force|Kosovo]] and [[Operation Sunrise (Albania)|Albania]].

Italy supported international efforts to reconstruct and stabilise [[Iraq]], but it had withdrawn its [[Multi-National Force – Iraq#2006 withdrawals|military contingent]] of some 3,200 troops by 2006, maintaining only humanitarian operators and other civilian personnel.
In August 2006 Italy deployed about 2,450 troops in Lebanon for the United Nations' [[peacekeeping]] mission [[UNIFIL]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsMax&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/08_Agosto/29/libano.shtml Italian soldiers leave for Lebanon] Corriere della Sera, 30 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Italy is one of the largest financiers of the [[Palestinian National Authority]], contributing €60 million in 2013 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Italy donates 60 million euros to PA|url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=626926|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=[[Ma'an News Agency]]|date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An autonomous corps of the military, the Carabinieri are the [[gendarmerie]] and [[military police]] of Italy, policing the military and civilian population alongside [[Law enforcement in Italy|Italy's other police forces]]. While the different branches of the Carabinieri report to separate ministries for each of their individual functions, the corps reports to the Ministry of Internal Affairs when maintaining public order and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Multilingua/EN/GoverningBodies/|title=The Carabinieri Force is linked to the Ministry of Defence|publisher=Carabinieri|accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy does not invest enough to maintain its drinking water supply and sanitation infrastructure, while water and sanitation tariffs are among the lowest in the European Union. The Galli Law, passed in 1993, aimed at raising the level of investment and to improve service quality by consolidating service providers, making them more efficient and increasing the level of cost recovery through tariff revenues.

Through the centuries, Italy has fostered the scientific community that produced many major discoveries in physics and the other sciences. During the [[Renaissance]] Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–72) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]].&lt;br&gt;
Other astronomers suchs as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625–1712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835–1910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]. In mathematics, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736–1813) was active before leaving Italy. [[Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 – c. 1250), and [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501–76) made fundamental advances in mathematics. [[Luca Pacioli]] established [[accounting]] to the world. Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901–54), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and was one of the key figures in the creation of the [[nuclear weapon]]. He, [[Emilio G. Segrè]] ((1905–89) who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]), [[Bruno Rossi]] ((1905–93) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]],.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Orlando, &quot;Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the&quot; New Tasks&quot; of Physics in Italy.&quot; ''Historical studies in the physical and biological sciences'' (1998): 141–181. {{jstor|27757806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent physicists include: [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (most noted for his contributions to [[molecular theory]], in particular the [[Avogadro's law]] and the [[Avogadro constant]]), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (inventor of [[barometer]]), [[Alessandro Volta]] (inventor of [[electric battery]]), [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (inventor of [[radio]]), [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Antonio Pacinotti]], pioneers of the induction motor, [[Alessandro Cruto]], pioneer of light bulb and [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics,  [[Ettore Majorana]] (who discovered the [[Majorana fermion]]s), [[Carlo Rubbia]] (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the [[W and Z particles]] at [[CERN]]).

In chemistry, [[Giulio Natta]] received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963 for his work on high [[polymers]]. [[Giuseppe Occhialini]] received the [[Wolf Prize in Physics]] for the discovery of the [[pion]] or pi-[[meson]] decay in 1947. [[Ennio de Giorgi]], a [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] recipient in 1990, solved [[Bernstein's problem]] about [[minimal surface]]s and the [[Hilbert's nineteenth problem|19th Hilbert problem]] on the regularity of solutions of [[Elliptic partial differential equations]].

{{Main article|Demographics of Italy}}
[[File:Map of population density in Italy (2011 census) alt colours.jpg|thumb|Map of population density in Italy as of the 2011 census.]]

At the end of 2013, Italy had 60,782,668 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National demographic balance, 2013|url=http://www.istat.it/it/files/2014/06/Bilanciodemografico_2013_def.pdf?title=Bilancio+demografico+nazionale+-+16%2Fgiu%2F2014+-+Testo+integrale.pdf|publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Istat]]|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting population density, at {{convert|202|PD/km2}}, is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia are very sparsely populated.

The population of Italy almost doubled during the 20th century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven because of large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the [[Italian economic miracle]] of the 1950–1960s. High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they start decline. The population rapidly [[population ageing|aged]]. At the end of the 2000s (decade), one in five Italians was over 65 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-072/EN/KS-SF-08-072-EN.PDF |title=Ageing characterises the demographic perspectives of the European societies – Issue number 72/2008 |author=[[EUROSTAT]] |accessdate=28 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102184227/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-072/EN/KS-SF-08-072-EN.PDF |archivedate= 2 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years Italy experienced a significant growth in birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2008/Tab_1.pdf|title=Crude birth rates, mortality rates and marriage rates 2005–2008|author=[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]|accessdate=10 May 2009|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2008/Tab_4.pdf |title=Average number of children born per woman 2005–2008|author=[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]|accessdate=3 May 2009|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===

[[File:COB data Italy.PNG|thumbnail|350px|Italy is home to a large population of migrants from Eastern Europe and North Africa]]

In 2016, Italy had about 5.05 million foreign residents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resident Foreigners on 31st December 2016|url=http://demo.istat.it/index_e.html|publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Istat]]|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making up 8.3% of the total population. The figures include more than half a million children born in Italy to foreign nationals—second generation immigrants, but exclude foreign nationals who have subsequently acquired Italian citizenship;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immigrants.Stat|url=http://stra-dati.istat.it/Index.aspx|publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Istat]]|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, about 201,000 people acquired Italian citizenship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National demographic balance 2016|url=https://www.istat.it/en/archive/201143|publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Istat]]|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (130,000 in 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National demographic balance 2014|url=http://www.istat.it/en/archive/162261|publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Istat]]|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official figures also exclude [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], that were estimated in 2008 to number at least 670,000.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Rosenthal, &quot;[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2008/05/16/italy_cracks_down_on_illegal_immigration/ Italy cracks down on illegal immigration]&quot;. ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. 16 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from the early 1980s, until then a linguistically and culturally homogeneous society, Italy begun to attract substantial flows of foreign immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Beverly|title=Revisioning Italy national identity and global culture|date=1997|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-8166-2727-1|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] and, more recently, the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004]] and [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2007]] enlargements of the European Union, large waves of migration originated from the former socialist countries of [[Eastern Europe]] (especially [[Romania]], [[Albania]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]]). An equally important source of immigration is neighbouring North Africa (in particular, [[Morocco]], Egypt and [[Tunisia]]), with soaring arrivals as a consequence of the [[Arab Spring]]. Furthermore, in recent years, growing migration fluxes from Asia-Pacific (notably [[China]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6550725.stm Milan police in Chinatown clash]&quot;. BBC News. 13 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Philippines]]) and Latin America have been recorded.

Currently, about one million [[Romanian diaspora|Romanian]] citizens (around 10% of them being from the [[Romani people]] ethnic group&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42404 EUROPE: Home to Roma, And No Place for Them]&quot;.

The number of unregistered Romanians is difficult to estimate, but the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network suggested in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birn.eu.com/en/111/15/5745/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029110649/http://www.birn.eu.com/en/111/15/5745/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 October 2008 |title=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network |publisher=Birn.eu.com |date=8 November 2007 |accessdate=4 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|According to Mitrica, an October 2005 Romanian report estimates that 1,061,400 Romanians are living in Italy, constituting 37% of 2.8&amp;nbsp;million immigrants in that country&lt;ref&gt;Mitrica, Mihai [https://web.archive.org/web/20071023072029/http://evz.ro/article.php?artid=201813 Un milion de romani s-au mutat in Italia] (&quot;One million Romanians have moved to Italy&quot;). ''Evenimentul Zilei'', 31 October 2005. Visited 11 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is unclear how the estimate was made, and therefore whether it should be taken seriously.|group=note}} Overall, at the end of the 2000s (decade) the foreign born population of Italy was from: Europe (54%), Africa (22%), Asia (16%), the Americas (8%) and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 87% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 13% live in the southern half of the peninsula.

According to the Article 12 of the Italian Constitution, Italy's official language is [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legge 15 Dicembre 1999, n. 482 &quot;Norme in materia di tutela delle minoranze linguistiche storiche&quot; pubblicata nella Gazzetta Ufficiale n. 297 del 20 dicembre 1999|url=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/99482l.htm|publisher=[[Italian Parliament]]|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that there are about 64 million native Italian speakers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ita Italian language] Ethnologue.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;europa2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_sum_en.pdf|title=Eurobarometer – Europeans and their languages|format=485&amp;nbsp;KB|date= February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nationalencyklopedin]] &quot;Världens 100 största språk 2007&quot; The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007&lt;/ref&gt; while the total number of Italian speakers, including those who use it as a second language, is about 85 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italian language&quot;&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/modern-languages/lal/languages%20at%20lal/italian Italian language] University of Leicester&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has numerous regional and minority languages;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297241/Italian-language |title=Italian language |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the establishment of a national education system has led to a decrease in variation in the languages spoken across the country during the 20th century. Standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s due to economic growth and the rise of [[Media of Italy|mass media]] and television (the state broadcaster [[RAI]] helped set a standard Italian).

Twelve historical [[minority language]]s are legally recognised: [[Arberesh language|Albanian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[French language|French]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Friulian]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]], [[Occitan]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (Law number 482 of 15 December 1999).&lt;ref name=&quot;parl&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/leggi/99482l.htm |title=Norme in materia di tutela delle minoranze linguistiche storiche |year= |publisher=Italian parliament |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; French is co-official in the [[Valle d’Aosta]]—although in fact [[Franco-Provencal]] is more commonly spoken there.&lt;ref&gt;[L.cost. 26 febbraio 1948, n. 4, Statuto speciale per la Valle d'Aosta; L.cost. 26 febbraio 1948, n. 5, Statuto speciale per il Trentino-Alto Adige; L. cost. 31 gennaio 1963, n. 1, Statuto speciale della Regione Friuli Venezia Giulia]&lt;/ref&gt; German has the same status in [[South Tyrol]] as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring [[Trentino]], does [[Ladin language|Ladin]]. [[Slovene language|Slovene]] is officially recognised in the provinces of [[Province of Trieste|Trieste]], [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]] and [[Province of Udine|Udine]]. A number of other Ethnologue, ISO and UNESCO recognised languages remain unrecognised by Italian law. Italy has signed the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], but has not ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/european-centre-for-minority-issues-vol-1-/1680737191|title=Ready for Ratification|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=European Centre for Minority Issues|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of significant recent immigration, Italy has sizeable populations whose native language is not Italian. According to the [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Italian National Institute of Statistics]], [[Romanian people|Romanian]] is the most common mother tongue among foreign residents in Italy: almost 800,000 people speak Romanian as their first language (21.9% of the foreign residents aged 6 and over). Other prevalent mother tongues are [[Arabic]] (spoken by over 475,000 people; 13.1% of foreign residents), [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (380,000 people) and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (255,000 people). Other languages spoken in Italy are [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Hindi]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istat.it/en/archive/129304|title=Linguistic diversity among foreign citizens in Italy |publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Italian National Institute of Statistics]] |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholicism]] is, by far, the largest religion in the country, although since 1985 no longer officially the [[state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Catholicism No Longer Italy's State Religion|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-06-04/news/8501220260_1_italian-state-new-agreement-church|accessdate=7 September 2013|newspaper=[[Sun Sentinel]]|date=4 June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the proportion of Italians that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 81.2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;pewresearch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Catholic Population|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/02/13/the-global-catholic-population/|website=pewresearch.org|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holy See]], the [[Diocese of Rome|episcopal jurisdiction of Rome]], contains the central government of the entire [[Roman Catholic Church]], including various [[Roman Curia|agencies]] essential to administration. Diplomatically, it is recognised by other subjects of international law as a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] entity, headed by the [[Pope]], who is also the [[Bishop of Rome]], with which [[diplomatic relations]] can be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Text taken directly from {{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/europe/holy-see/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231084624/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/europe/holy-see/ |archivedate=31 December 2010 |df= }} (viewed on 14 December 2011), on the website of the British Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Holy See's sovereignty has been recognized explicitly in many international agreements and is particularly emphasized in article 2 of the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 11 February 1929, in which &quot;Italy recognizes the sovereignty of the Holy See in international matters as an inherent attribute in conformity with its traditions and the requirements of its mission to the world&quot; ([http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/treaty.htm Lateran Treaty, English translation]).&lt;/ref&gt; Often incorrectly referred to as &quot;the Vatican&quot;, the Holy See is not the same entity as the [[Vatican City]] State, which came into existence only in 1929; the Holy See dates back to early Christian times. Ambassadors are officially accredited not to the Vatican City State but to &quot;the Holy See&quot;, and papal representatives to states and international organisations are recognised as representing the Holy See, not the Vatican City State.

Minority Christian faiths in Italy include [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Waldensians]] and other [[Protestant]] communities.

One of the longest-established minority religious faiths in Italy is [[Italian Jews|Judaism]], Jews having been present in [[Ancient Rome]] since before the birth of Christ. Italy has for centuries welcomed Jews expelled from other countries, notably Spain. However, as a result of the [[Holocaust]], about 20% of Italian Jews lost their lives.&lt;ref name=isbn0553343025&gt;{{cite book|author=Dawidowicz, Lucy S.|title=The war against the Jews, 1933–1945|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|year=1986|isbn=0-553-34302-5}}p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; This, together with the emigration that preceded and followed World War II, has left only a small community of around 28,400 Jews in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE JEWISH COMMUNITY OF ITALY Unione delle Comunita Ebraiche Italiane|url=http://www.eurojewcong.org/communities/italy.html|publisher=The European Jewish Congress|accessdate=25 August 2014}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soaring immigration in the last two decades has been accompanied by an increase in non-Christian faiths. In 2010, there were 1.6 million Muslims in Italy, forming 2.6% of population.&lt;ref name=&quot;pewresearch&quot;/&gt; In addition, there are more than 200,000 followers of faiths originating in the Indian subcontinent with some 70,000 [[Sikhs]] with 22 [[gurdwaras]] across the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nriinternet.com/EUROPE/ITALY/2004/111604Gurdwara.htm |title=NRI Sikhs in Italy |publisher=Nriinternet.com |date=15 November 2004 |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70,000 [[Hindus]], and 50,000 [[Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhismo.it/ente.htm |title=Unione Buddhista Italiana – UBI: L'Ente |publisher=Buddhismo.it |date=18 August 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404034319/http://www.buddhismo.it/ente.htm |archivedate= 4 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were an estimated 4,900 [[Bahá'ís]] in Italy in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCE-05&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Most Baha'i Nations (2005)|work=QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt;|publisher=The Association of Religion Data Archives|year=2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp|accessdate =30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian state, as a measure to protect religious freedom, devolves shares of income tax to recognised religious communities, under a regime known as [[Eight per thousand]] (''Otto per mille''). Donations are allowed to Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and Hindu communities; however, Islam remains excluded, since no Muslim communities have yet signed a concordat with the Italian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Religion/?id=3.1.880028077 |title=Italy: Islam denied income tax revenue – Adnkronos Religion |publisher=Adnkronos.com |date=7 April 2003 |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taxpayers who do not wish to fund a religion contribute their share to the state welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documenti.camera.it/Leg16/dossier/Testi/BI0350.htm#_Toc278992388 Camera dei deputati Dossier BI0350].

Primary education lasts eight years. The students are given a basic education in Italian, English, mathematics, natural sciences, history, geography, social studies, physical education and visual and musical arts. Secondary education lasts for five years and includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the ''[[Secondary education in Italy#liceo|liceo]]'' prepares students for university studies with a classical or scientific curriculum, while the ''[[istituto tecnico]]'' and the ''[[Istituto professionale]]'' prepare pupils for vocational education. In 2012, the Italian secondary education has been evalued as slightly below the [[OECD]] average, with a strong and steady improvement in science and mathematics results since 2003;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PISA 2012 Results|url=http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/PISA-2012-results-italy.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, a wide gap exists between [[northern Italy|northern]] schools, which performed significantly better than the national average (among the best in the world in some subjects), and schools in the [[Southern Italy|South]], that had much poorer results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The literacy divide: territorial differences in the Italian education system|url=http://new.sis-statistica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/CO09-The-literacy-divide-territorial-differences-in-the-Italian.pdf|publisher=Parthenope University of Naples|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy has more [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Italy|World Heritage Sites]] ([[Table of World Heritage Sites by country|53]]) than any other country in the world, and has rich collections of art, culture and literature from many different periods. The country has had a broad cultural influence worldwide, also because numerous Italians emigrated to other places during the [[Italian diaspora]]. Furthermore, the nation has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort (museums, palaces, buildings, statues, churches, art galleries, villas, fountains, historic houses and archaeological remains).&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyewitness Travel 2005, pg. 19&quot;&gt;Eyewitness Travel (2005), pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
{{Main article|Architecture of Italy}}
Italy has a very broad and diverse architectural style, which cannot be simply classified by period, but also by region, because of Italy's division into several regional states until 1861. This has created a highly diverse and eclectic range in architectural designs.

Italy is known for its considerable architectural achievements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justitaly.org/italy/italy-architecture.asp Architecture in Italy], ItalyTravel.com&lt;/ref&gt; such as the construction of arches, domes and similar structures during [[ancient Rome]], the founding of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance architectural movement]] in the late-14th to 16th centuries, and being the homeland of [[Palladianism]], a style of construction which inspired movements such as that of [[Neoclassical architecture]], and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world, notably in the UK, Australia and the US during the late 17th to early 20th centuries. Several of the finest works in Western architecture, such as the [[Colosseum]], the [[Milan Cathedral]] and [[Florence cathedral]], the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and the building designs of [[Venice]] are found in Italy.

Italian architecture has also widely influenced the architecture of the world. British architect [[Inigo Jones]], inspired by the designs of Italian buildings and cities, brought back the ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture to 17th-century England, being inspired by [[Andrea Palladio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/jones_inigo.shtml |title=History – Historic Figures: Inigo Jones (1573–1652) |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Italianate architecture]], popular abroad since the 19th century, was used to describe foreign architecture which was built in an Italian style, especially modelled on [[Renaissance architecture]].

The history of Italian visual art is part of [[Western painting]] history. [[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main &quot;styles&quot; or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons. Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]]. From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture.

The [[Italian Renaissance]] is said by many to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Giorgione]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]''. Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], [[Luca Della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylised art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. In the 17th century, among the greatest painters of [[Italian Baroque]] are [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]]. Subsequently, in the 18th century, [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Canaletto]]. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with [[Antonio Canova]]'s nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.

In the 19th century, major Italian [[Romantic painting|Romantic]] painters were [[Francesco Hayez]], [[Giuseppe Bezzuoli]] and [[Francesco Podesti]]. [[Impressionism]] was brought from France to Italy by the ''[[Macchiaioli]]'', led by [[Giovanni Fattori]], and [[Giovanni Boldini]]; [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] by [[Gioacchino Toma]] and [[Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo]]. In the 20th century, with [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of [[Giorgio de Chirico]], who exerted a strong influence on the [[Surrealists]] and generations of artists to follow.

=== Literature and theatre ===
{{Main article|Literature of Italy}}

Italian literature began after the founding of Rome in 753 BC. Roman, or Latin literature, was and still is highly influential in the world, with numerous writers, poets, philosophers, and historians, such as [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pliny the Younger]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Propertius]], [[Ovid]] and [[Livy]]. The Romans were also famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama and epigrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Poetry and Drama: Literary Terms and Concepts.''|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|date=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHA_SydyKOYC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early years of the 13th century, St. [[Francis of Assisi]] was considered the first Italian poet by literary critics, with his religious song ''[[Canticle of the Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | chapter=2 - Poetry.

[[File:DanteDetail.jpg|thumb|[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], poised between the mountain of [[Purgatory]] and the city of Florence, displays the famous incipit &quot;''Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita&quot;'' of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' in a detail of [[Domenico di Michelino]]'s painting, 1465]]

Another Italian voice originated in Sicily. At the court of emperor Frederick II, who ruled the Sicilian kingdom during the first half of the 13th century, lyrics modeled on Provençal forms and themes were written in a refined version of the local vernacular. The most important of these poets was the notary [[Giacomo da Lentini]], inventor of the [[sonnet]] form, though the most famous early sonneteer was [[Petrarch]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Hatch Wilkins, ''The invention of the sonnet, and other studies in Italian literature'' (Rome: Edizioni di Storia e letteratura, 1959), 11–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guido Guinizelli]] is considered the founder of the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]'', a school that added a philosophical dimension to traditional love poetry. This new understanding of love, expressed in a smooth, pure style, influenced [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and the [[Florence|Florentine]] poet [[Dante Alighieri]], who established the basis of the modern [[Italian language]]; his greatest work, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', is considered among the foremost literary statements produced in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]; furthermore, the poet invented the difficult ''[[terza rima]]''. The two great writers of the 14th century, Petrarch and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], sought out and imitated the works of antiquity and cultivated their own artistic personalities. Petrarch achieved fame through his collection of poems, ''[[Il Canzoniere]]''. Petrarch's love poetry served as a model for centuries. Equally influential was Boccaccio's ''[[The Decameron]]'', one of the most popular collections of short stories ever written.&lt;ref name=Britannica-Shakespeare&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Giovanni Boccaccio: The Decameron.| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| location = | date = | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70836/Giovanni-Boccaccio/755/The-Decameron | accessdate = 18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]], founder of the modern political science and ethics]]

Italian Renaissance authors produced a number of important works. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' is one of the world's most famous essays on political science and modern philosophy, in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. Another important work of the period, [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', continuation of [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]]'s unfinished romance ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'', is perhaps the greatest chivalry poem ever written. [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s dialogue ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' describes the ideal of the perfect court gentleman and of spiritual beauty. The lyric poet [[Torquato Tasso]] in ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' wrote a Christian epic, making use of the ''[[ottava rima]]'', with attention to the Aristotelian canons of unity.

[[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] and [[Giambattista Basile]], which have written ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' (1550–1555) and the ''[[Pentamerone]]'' (1634) respectively, printed some of the first known versions of fairy tales in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Swann Jones, ''The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of Imagination'', Twayne Publishers, New York, 1995, {{ISBN|0-8057-0950-9}}, p38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bottigheimer 2012a, 7; Waters 1894, xii; Zipes 2015, 599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Opie |first=Iona |authorlink2=Peter Opie| first2 =Peter|last2 = Opie |authorlink=Iona Opie |title=The Classic Fairy Tales |location=Oxford and New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=1974 |isbn=0-19-211559-6}} See page 20.

Leithart, 9 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 17th century, some literary masterpieces were created, such as [[Giambattista Marino]]'s long mythological poem, ''[[Giambattista Marino#L'Adone|L'Adone]]''. The Baroque period also produced the clear scientific prose of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] as well as [[Tommaso Campanella]]'s ''[[The City of the Sun]]'', a description of a perfect society ruled by a philosopher-priest. At the end of the 17th century, the [[Academy of Arcadia|Arcadians]] began a movement to restore simplicity and classical restraint to poetry, as in [[Metastasio]]'s heroic melodramas. In the 18th century, playwright [[Carlo Goldoni]] created full written plays, many portraying the middle class of his day.

The Romanticism coincided with some ideas of the ''[[Risorgimento]]'', the patriotic movement that brought Italy political unity and freedom from foreign domination. Italian writers embraced Romanticism in the early 19th century. The time of Italy's rebirth was heralded by the poets [[Vittorio Alfieri]], [[Ugo Foscolo]], and [[Giacomo Leopardi]]. ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' by [[Alessandro Manzoni]], the leading Italian Romantic, was the first Italian historical novel to glorify Christian values of justice and Providence, and it has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archibald Colquhoun 1954&quot;&gt;Archibald Colquhoun. ''Manzoni and his Times.'' J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, London, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, a realistic literary movement called ''[[Verismo (literature)|Verismo]]'' played a major role in Italian literature; [[Giovanni Verga]] and [[Luigi Capuana]] were its main exponents. In the same period, [[Emilio Salgari]], writer of action adventure [[swashbuckler]]s and a pioneer of science fiction, published his ''[[Sandokan]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gaetana Marrone|author2=Paolo Puppa|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9NcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1654|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45530-9|page=1654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, [[Carlo Collodi]] also published the novel ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', the most celebrated children's classic by an Italian author and the most translated non-religious book in the world.&lt;ref name=Gasparini&gt;Giovanni Gasparini. ''La corsa di Pinocchio''. Milano, Vita e Pensiero, 1997. p. 117. {{ISBN|88-343-4889-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A movement called [[Futurism]] influenced Italian literature in the early 20th century. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] wrote ''[[Manifesto of Futurism]]'', called for the use of language and metaphors that glorified the speed, dynamism, and violence of the machine age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=dsdLondon|isbn=0714835420|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern literary figures and Nobel laureates are [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] from 1889 to 1910, nationalist poet [[Giosuè Carducci]] in 1906, realist writer [[Grazia Deledda]] in 1926, modern theatre author [[Luigi Pirandello]] in 1936, short stories writer [[Italo Calvino]] in 1960, poets [[Salvatore Quasimodo]] in 1959 and [[Eugenio Montale]] in 1975, [[Umberto Eco]] in 1980, and satirist and theatre author [[Dario Fo]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/|title=All Nobel Prizes in Literature |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent [[Italian philosophy|Italian philosophers]] include [[Cesare Beccaria]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Benedetto Croce]], [[Marsilio Ficino]], and [[Giambattista Vico]].

Italian theatre can be traced back to the Roman tradition which was heavily influenced by the Greek; as with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists tended to adapt and translate from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''Phaedra'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the comedies of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]]. During the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]] and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''.

From [[Italian folk music|folk music]] to [[European classical music|classical]], music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, and many of the prevailing classical music forms, such as the [[symphony]], concerto, and [[sonata]], can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music.

Italy's most famous composers include the [[List of Renaissance composers#Italian|Renaissance composers]] [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] and [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], the [[List of Baroque composers|Baroque composers]] [[Alessandro Scarlatti|Scarlatti]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], the [[List of Classical era composers|Classical composers]] [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], and the [[List of Romantic-era composers|Romantic composers]] [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]. Modern Italian composers such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Nono]] proved significant in the development of [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[electronic music]]. While the classical music tradition still holds strong in Italy, as evidenced by the fame of its innumerable opera houses, such as ''[[La Scala]]'' of Milan and ''[[Teatro di San Carlo|San Carlo]]'' of Naples, and performers such as the pianist [[Maurizio Pollini]] and the late tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]], Italians have been no less appreciative of their thriving contemporary music scene.

La Scala operahouse in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world. Famous Italian opera singers include [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Alessandro Bonci]].

Introduced in the early 1920s, [[jazz]] took a particularly strong foothold in Italy, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centres of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the [[progressive rock]] and pop movement of the 1970s, with bands like [[Premiata Forneria Marconi|PFM]], [[Banco del Mutuo Soccorso]], [[Le Orme]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], and [[Pooh (band)|Pooh]]. The same period saw diversification in the [[cinema of Italy]], and [[Cinecittà]] films included complex scores by composers including [[Ennio Morricone]], [[Armando Trovaioli]], [[Piero Piccioni]] and [[Piero Umiliani]]. The [[Italian hip hop]] scene began in the early 1990s with [[Articolo 31]] duo, mainly influenced by the East Coast rap.

Italy was also an important country in the development of [[disco]] and [[electronic music]], with [[Italo disco]], known for its futuristic sound and prominent usage of synthesisers and [[drum machine]]s, being one of the earliest electronic dance genres, as well as European forms of disco aside from [[Euro disco]] (which later went on to influence several genres such as [[Eurodance]] and [[Nu-disco]]). Notable Italian DJs and remixers include [[Benny Benassi]], [[Gigi D'Agostino]], and [[Gabry Ponte]], member of the [[Eiffel 65]] group.

Producers such as [[Giorgio Moroder]], who won three [[Academy Award]]s for his music, were highly influential in the development of [[electronic dance music]]. Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the [[Sanremo Music Festival]], which served as inspiration for the [[Eurovision]] song contest, and the [[Festival of Two Worlds]] in [[Spoleto]]. Singers such as [[Mina (singer)|Mina]], [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Grammy]] winner [[Laura Pausini]], [[Eros Ramazzotti]] and [[Tiziano Ferro]] have attained international acclaim.

=== Cinema ===
{{Main article|Cinema of Italy}}
The history of Italian cinema began a few months after the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] began motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian film was a few seconds, showing [[Pope Leo XIII]] giving a blessing to the camera. The Italian film industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the Società Italiana Cines, the [[Ambrosio Film]] and the Itala Film. Other companies soon followed in Milan and in Naples. In a short time these first companies reached a fair producing quality, and films were soon sold outside Italy. Cinema was later used by [[Benito Mussolini]], who founded Rome's renowned [[Cinecittà]] studio for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/italians/resources/Amiciprize/1996/mussolini.html |title=The Cinema Under Mussolini |publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Italian film was widely recognised and exported until an artistic decline around the 1980s. [[List of film directors from Italy|Notable Italian film directors]] from this period include [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Sergio Leone]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Luchino Visconti]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Roberto Rossellini]]; some of these are recognized among the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Bicycle Thief / Bicycle Thieves (1949)|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990319/REVIEWS08/903190306/1023|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/the-25-most-influential-directors-of-all-time-3358/|title=The 25 Most Influential Directors of All Time|work=MovieMaker Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-most-influential-directors-of-all-time.php/2|title=10 Most Influential Directors Of All Time|work=WhatCulture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movies include world cinema treasures such as ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', ''[[La dolce vita]]'', ''[[8½]]'', ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]''.

[[File:Cinecittà - Entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to [[Cinecittà]] in Rome, the largest film studio in Europe]]

As the country grew wealthier in the 1950s, a form of neorealism known as pink neorealism succeeded, and other [[film genre]]s, such as [[sword-and-sandal]] followed as [[spaghetti western]]s, were popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Actresses such as [[Sophia Loren]], [[Giulietta Masina]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]] achieved international stardom during this period. Erotic Italian thrillers, or ''[[giallo]]s'', produced by directors such as [[Mario Bava]] and [[Dario Argento]] in the 1970s, also influenced the horror genre worldwide. In recent years, the Italian scene has received only occasional international attention, with movies like ''[[Life Is Beautiful]]'' directed by [[Roberto Benigni]], ''[[Il Postino: The Postman]]'' with [[Massimo Troisi]] and ''[[The Great Beauty]]'' directed by [[Paolo Sorrentino]].

{{Main article|Italian cuisine}}
[[File:Italian food.JPG|thumb|Some typical Italian foods: [[pizza]] ([[Pizza Margherita|Margherita]]), [[pasta]] ([[Carbonara]]), [[espresso]], and [[gelato]]]]

The Italian [[cuisine]] has developed through centuries of social and political changes, with [[Ancient Roman cuisine|roots]] as far back as the 4th century BC. Italian cuisine in itself takes heavy influences, including [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Ancient Greek cuisine|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient Roman cuisine|ancient Roman]], [[Byzantine cuisine|Byzantine]], and [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inmamaskitchen.com/ITALIAN_COOKING/rome_Lazio/Rome_LAZIO.html |title=Italian Cooking: History of Food and Cooking in Rome and Lazio Region, Papal Influence, Jewish Influence, The Essence of Roman Italian Cooking |publisher=Inmamaskitchen.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410100532/http://www.inmamaskitchen.com/ITALIAN_COOKING/rome_Lazio/Rome_LAZIO.html |archivedate=10 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the [[New World]] with the introduction of items such as [[potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[bell pepper]]s and [[maize]], now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurean.com/articles/making-of-italian-food.html |title=The Making of Italian Food...From the Beginning |publisher=Epicurean.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, 11–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Related Articles |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/718430/Italian-cuisine |title=Italian cuisine – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2 January 2009 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indigoguide.com/italy/food.htm |title=Italian Food – Italy's Regional Dishes &amp; Cuisine |publisher=Indigoguide.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102020059/http://www.indigoguide.com/italy/food.htm |archivedate=2 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusticocooking.com/regions.htm |title=Regional Italian Cuisine |publisher=Rusticocooking.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; abundance of difference in taste, and is known to be one of the most popular in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/eat/worlds-best-food-cultures-453528 |title=Which country has the best food? |publisher=CNN |date=6 January 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; wielding strong influence abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman |first=Nancy |url=http://www.sallybernstein.com/food/cuisines/us/ |title=American Food, Cuisine |publisher=Sallybernstein.com |date=2 March 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mediterranean diet]] forms the basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and vegetables and characterised by its extreme simplicity and variety, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;The Silver Spoon {{ISBN|88-7212-223-6}}, 1997 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Batali Simple Italian Food: Recipes from My Two Villages (1998), {{ISBN|0-609-60300-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dishes and recipes are often derivatives from local and familial tradition rather than created by [[chef]]s, so many recipes are ideally suited for [[home cooking]], this being one of the main reasons behind the ever-increasing worldwide popularity of Italian cuisine, from America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Americans Have Dined Outin the Past Month and, Among Type of Cuisine, American Food is Tops Followed by Italian|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/HarrisPoll18-DiningOut_4-3-13.pdf|publisher=[[Harris interactive]]|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kazmin|first=Amy|title=A taste for Italian in New Delhi|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7ab87234-9214-11e2-851f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2dZCeLdLg|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingredients and dishes vary widely by [[Regions of Italy|region]].

'''Mattarello''' ({{lang-de|Madrell}}) is a small town in [[Trentino]], Italy. It has been subsumed into a ''[[frazione]]'' of the ''[[comune]]'' of [[Trento]], having previously been an independent ''comune''. It has a population of 6,018.

In Mattarello you can find the interdepartmental research centre [http://www.unitn.it/en/cibio CIBIO](Centre for Integrative Biology, part of University of Trento). The Centre will pursue the task of creating a suitable environment for merging classical cellular and molecular biology approaches with the new powerful tools of systems and synthetic biology, and with the contribution of chemistry, physics, informatics, mathematics, and engineering in an integrative view of basic biological processes and of their derangement in disease.

Trento [[airport]] is near the town, and there is an [[Aviation museum|aeronautical museum]], in the honour of [[Giovanni Battista Caproni|Gianni Caproni]], adjacent to the airport: the ''[[Museo dell'Aeronautica Gianni Caproni]]'' (Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics).

==History==
[[File:Trofei Trentino Volley.jpg|thumb|First trophies of Trentino Club]]
Trentino Volley SpA was founded on May 23, 2000;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trentinovolley.it/societa/la-societa.html|title=Storia dell'Itas Diatec Trentino|language=Italian|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two days later, it purchased the rights to play in the Serie A1 (Italy's First Division) from Ravenna, that had retired due to financial problems. The club played its first Serie A1 match in Parma on October 15, 2000, against Maxicono [[Parma]], and was defeated 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legavolley.it/TabellinoGara.asp?IdGara=2644|title=legavolley.it – 1a giornata 2000–2001|language=Italian|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first home match of the Trentino Volley was played on October 22, 2000, against Padova, and the home team came out victorious with a result of 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legavolley.it/TabellinoGara.asp?IdGara=2679|title=legavolley.it – 2a giornata 2000–2001|language=Italian|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Trentino Volley are by far the most successful side in the history of the FIVB Volleyball Men’s Club World Championship, having won the title a total of four times.
However, the Italian club, founded in 2000 and based in the city of Trento in the northeast of the country, only managed a bronze in 2013, were knocked out during pool play in 2014 (ending up 5th) and missed out on the 2015 edition of the competition.
During its first two seasons, the team managed a tenth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legavolley.it/Risultati.asp?Anno=2000&amp;refCampionato=463|title=Classifica stagione 2000–2001|language=Italian|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ninth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legavolley.it/Risultati.asp?Anno=2001&amp;refCampionato=100|title=Classifica stagione 2001–2002|language=Italian|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; place finish at the end of the regular season.

Players acquired by the team in his first Italian Serie A years included [[Lorenzo Bernardi]] and [[Andrea Sartoretti]]. In the summer of 2007 Trentino Volley made substantial purchases, as part of a strategy that would focus on a young team with talented players, such as Serbian [[Nikola Grbić]], Bulgarians [[Vladimir Nikolov]] and [[Matey Kaziyski]] and Italian [[Emanuele Birarelli]]. Itas Trentino Diatec ended the following regular season with a first-place finish, and stepped into the finals. On May 7, 2008 Trentino Volley defeated [[Piacenza]] 3–0,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trentinovolley.it/news/rassegna-stampa/archivio/2008/maggio/3012-giovedi-8-maggio-2008/download.html|title=L'Itas è Campione d'Italia|language=Italian|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; to win its first national championship title, and gain access to the CEV Champions League 2008–2009.

Trento run undefeated in the pool stages, with a first-place finish in Group E. On April 5, 2009, at the ''O2 Arena'' in [[Prague]], Trento defeated Iraklis Thessaloniki 3–1 in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trentinovolley.it/news/notizie/5593.html|title=Trento-Salonicco 5 aprile 2009|language=Italian|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, the team flew to [[Doha]] ([[Qatar]]), to compete in the [[FIVB Men's Club World Volleyball Championship]]. On Sunday November 8, Trentino Betclic won the final, with a score of 3–0&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trentinovolley.it/news/notizie/6207-belchatow-piegato-3-0-trentino-betclic-campione-del-mondo.html|title=PGE Skra Bełchatów-Trentino BetClic|language=Italian|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the Poles of [[Skra Bełchatów]], and became FIVB Club World Champion. In 2010, it won the Italian Cup and then successfully defended its Champions League title with a 3–0 victory (25–12,25–20, 25–21) over Dynamo Moscow.

The '''Giro al Sas''', also known as the '''Giro Podistico di Trento''' and the '''Giro Internazionale Città di Trento''', is an annual 10-kilometre [[road running]] competition for men which takes place in October in the city of [[Trento]], Italy.

First held as a part of celebrations for [[Saint Vigilius of Trent]] in 1907, the competition was interrupted by World Wars but has been held virtually every year since 1945. This makes it one of Europe's longest-running competitions of its type. The race has been won by some of Italy's most successful [[long-distance runner]]s, including [[Stefano Baldini]], as well as elite foreign athletes such as [[Paul Tergat]] and [[Kenenisa Bekele]].

The race is held within the city centre and starts and finishes at Piazza del Duomo. The name of the race, roughly translated as the ''Sas Circuit'', derives from the fact that the course features ten kilometre-long loops on the main city streets – which are locally referred to as ''al Sas''.

The running event should not be confused with the similarly named [[Giro del Trentino]] – a [[road cycling]] competition which the city has hosted since 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girodeltrentino.com/EN/1/9/Albo-Doro.htm Albo d’oro dal 1962 al 2009]. Giro al Trentino. Retrieved on 2010-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of the competition can be traced back to 1907 when a community group organised a race on the city streets of roughly 6&amp;nbsp;km as part of the festival of [[Saint Vigilius of Trent]]. Domenico Gottin, a runner from [[Veneto]], was the first to cross the line but he was later disqualified for taking a short cut, leaving Isidoro Trenner (a member of the local sports club) as the winner of the inaugural race. The race became an annual tradition, although it ceased during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Storia&gt;[http://www.sportrentino.it/portale/novitast/pagina.asp?pid=8 Un balzo nel passato] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722055434/http://www.sportrentino.it/portale/novitast/pagina.asp?pid=8 |date=2011-07-22 }} {{it icon}}. Giro al Sas. Retrieved on 2010-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trento-cathedral of saint Vigilio from east.jpg|left|thumb|[[Trento Cathedral]] is central to the race circuit.]]

It re-emerged in the post-war period and gained its current moniker of the Giro al Sas at this point – a name roughly meaning the ''Sas Circuit'', which derived from the race's looped course on the city's main streets which were known as ''the Sas''. The running competition was placed on hiatus from 1940–44 due to [[World War II]]. The Giro al Sas returned to the streets in November 1945, just months after the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy's surrender to the Allied Forces]].&lt;ref name=Storia/&gt;

After the wars, the race entered a new, uninterrupted era (with the exception of 1991 and 1996) and gradually became international in nature with elite athlete competition. Alongside other Italian races, such as the [[Giro di Castelbuono]], it is among the oldest road running competitions which continue to the present day. The current race director is [[Gianni Demadonna]], a former athlete and [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] manager who won the race three times in his running career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/news/Kind=2/newsId=27644.html Olympic champion Baldini accelerates comfortably to Trento victory].

==Course and records==
[[File:Trento panorama.jpg|thumb|250px|An overview of the city and the streets where the race takes place]]
The course of the race has varied through its history: it was a 15&amp;nbsp;km race in the 1960s, before existing as a 12&amp;nbsp;km circuit from 1970 to the mid-1990s. From 1997 to 2004, the race typically featured ten laps spanning 10.9&amp;nbsp;km. It has been a 10&amp;nbsp;km race from 2005 to present.&lt;ref name=ARRS&gt;Malcolm Heyworth et al (2010-10-12).

Retrieved on 2010-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The current course of ten 1&amp;nbsp;km laps features many twists and bends as it traces a circular loop around the central city streets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giroalsas.it/grafica/mappa.jpg Mappa].

[[Paul Kimaiyo Kimugul]] of [[Kenya]] holds the fastest time for the 10&amp;nbsp;km distance via his winning run of 28:00 minutes from 2005. Over the 10.9&amp;nbsp;km circuit, another Kenyan – [[Paul Kosgei Malakwen]] – has the course record with 30:46 minutes.&lt;ref name=ARRS/&gt; Although it has almost exclusively been a men's race only for its entire history, a women's competition was added to the programme for the 2005 edition – this 10&amp;nbsp;km race was won in 33:15 minutes by [[Bruna Genovese]], an Italian professional [[marathon]] runner.&lt;ref name=2005Ed/&gt;

==Past winners==
Little information about the race (or its winners) in its early history is available and the modern competition regards its post-war rebirth in 1945 as the start of its modern, continuous lineage.&lt;ref name=ARRS/&gt;

It is the capital of [[Trentino]]. In the 16th century, the city was the location of the [[Council of Trent]]. Formerly part of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], it was annexed by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in 1919.

Trento is an educational, scientific, financial and political centre in [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], in [[Tyrol]] and [[Northern Italy]] in general. The [[University of Trento]] ranks highly out of Italy's top 30 colleges, coming 1st in the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research ranking,&lt;ref name=&quot;miur&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriereuniv.it/cms/2009/07/atenei-virtuosi-la-classifica-del-miur/ |title=Classifica Università Virtuose |publisher=Corriere dell&quot;università |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1st according to Census ranking&lt;ref name=&quot;censis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitn.it/ateneo/50183/indagine-censis-la-repubblica-grande-guida-alluniversita |title=Classifica Censis 2017 |publisher=Censis |accessdate=2017-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 5th in the ''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'' ranking of Italian universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ilsole24ore.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/speciali/atenei_classifica/universita_dati2-tipo_statale.shtml |title=Le pagelle alle università |publisher=Il Sole 24 Ore |accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city contains a picturesque Medieval and Renaissance historic centre, with ancient buildings such as [[Trento Cathedral]] and the [[Castello del Buonconsiglio]].

Together with other Alpine towns Trento engages in the [[Alpine Town of the Year]] Association for the implementation of the Alpine Convention to achieve sustainable development in the Alpine Arc.

Trento was awarded the title of Alpine Town of the Year 2004.

Modern-day Trento is a cosmopolitan city, with highly developed and organized modern social services.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The city often ranks extremely highly out of all 103 Italian cities for [[quality of life]], [[standard of living]], and [[business opportunity|business and job opportunities]], coming 1st, 6th and 2nd respectively in 2010 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/includes2007/speciali/qualita-della-vita/scheda_finale.shtml |title=Qualita' della vita: il dossier |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |date= |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trento is also one of the nation's wealthiest and most prosperous cities, with its [[Trentino|province]] being one of the richest in Italy, although poorer than its neighbors [[Lombardy]] and [[South Tyrol]], with a [[GDP per capita]] of €31,200 and a [[GDP]] (nominal) of €16.563&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STAT-14-29_en.pdf GDP per capita in the EU in 2011: seven capital regions among the ten most prosperous]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
The township of Trento encompasses the city center as well as many suburbs of extremely varied geographical and population conditions (from the industrial suburb of Gardolo, just north of the city, to tiny mountain hamlets on Monte Bondone). Various distinctive suburbs still retain their traditional identity of rural or mountain villages.

Trento lies in a wide [[glacial valley]] known as the [[Adige|Adige valley]], just south of the [[Dolomite Mountains]], where the Fersina River and [[Avisio River|Avisio]] rivers join the [[Adige|Adige River]] (the second longest river in Italy). River Adige is one of the three primary south-flowing Alpine rivers; its broadly curving course alongside Trento was straightened in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1940:215, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The valley is surrounded by mountains, including Vigolana ({{convert|2,150|m|ft|abbr=on}}), Monte Bondone ({{convert|2,181|m|ft|abbr=on}}), [[Paganella]] ({{convert|2,124|m|ft|abbr=on}}), Marzola ({{convert|1,747|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Monte Calisio]] ({{convert|1,096|m|ft|abbr=on}}). Nearby lakes include [[Lake Caldonazzo]], Lake Levico, [[Lake Garda]] and Lake Toblino.

In 2007, there were 112,637 people residing in Trento, of whom 48% were male and 52% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 18.01 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 19.37 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Trento residents is 41 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Trento grew by 5.72 percent, while [[Italy]] as a whole grew by 3.56 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/bil2007/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |date= |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current birth rate of Trento is 9.61 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.

{{As of|2006}}, 92.68% of the population was [[Italian people|Italian]]. The largest immigrant group came from other [[Europe]]an countries (mostly [[Albania]], [[Romania]]): 4.13%, [[North Africa]]: 1.08%, and the [[Americas]]: 0.85%.

Trento Informa (a magazine distributed by the &quot;comune&quot;) reports that in 2011 there were 117,190 people residing in Trento, of whom  48.5% aged between 45 and 65.

The origins of this city on the river track to [[Bolzano]] and the low Alpine passes of [[Brenner Pass|Brenner]] and the [[Reschen Pass]]&lt;ref&gt;Griffith Taylor, &quot;Trento to the Reschen Pass: A Cultural Traverse of the Adige Corridor&quot;, ''Geographical Review'' '''30'''.2 (April 1940:215-237), &quot;The site and evolution of the town of Trento&quot;, pp 220-.&lt;/ref&gt; over the Alps are disputed. Some scholars maintain it was a [[Rhaetia]]n settlement: the Adige area was however influenced by neighbouring populations, including the [[Adriatic Veneti|(Adriatic) Veneti]], the [[Etruscans]] and the [[Gaul]]s (a [[Celt]]ic people). According to other theories, the latter did instead found the city during the 4th century BC.

Trento was conquered by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the late 1st century BC, after several clashes with the Rhaetian tribes. Before the Romans, Trento was a Celtic village. In reality, the name derives from ''Trent'', which is a tribute to the Celtic god of the waters (because of the river Adige){{citation needed|date=February 2015}}. The Romans gave their settlement the name ''Tridentum'' and is a tribute to the Roman god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] (Tri Dentum, meaning 'Three Teeth' because of the three hills that surround the city: the ''Doss Trent'', ''Sant'Agata'' and ''San Rocco''). The Latin name is the source of the adjective &quot;tridentine&quot;. On the old city hall, a [[Latin]] inscription is still visible: &quot;''Montes argentum mihi dant nomenque Tridentum''&quot; (&quot;Mountains give me silver and the name of Trento&quot;), attributed to Fra' Bartolomeo da Trento (died in 1251). Tridentum became an important stop on the [[Roman road]] that led from [[Verona]] to [[Innsbruck]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1940:221.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the independent bishopric of Trento was conquered by [[Ostrogoths]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Lombards]] and [[Franks]], finally becoming part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1027, Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] created the [[Prince-Bishops of Trento]], who wielded both temporal and religious powers. In the following centuries, however, the sovereignty was divided between the [[Bishopric of Trent]] and the [[County of Tyrol]] (from 1363 part of the Habsburg monarchy). Around 1200, Trento became a mining center of some significance: silver was mined from the Monte Calisio - Khalisperg, and Prince-Bishop [[Federico Wanga]] issued the first mining code of the alpine region.

In the 14th century, the region of Trento was part of Austria. The dukes of [[Austria]] ([[Habsburg]] Family) were also the counts of [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and dominated the region for six centuries (1918).

A dark episode in the history of Trento was the Trento [[blood libel]]. When a 3-year-old Christian boy, Simonino, later known as [[Simon of Trent]], disappeared in 1475 on the eve of [[Good Friday]], the city's small Jewish community was accused of killing him and draining his blood for Jewish ritual purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;iht.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/04/arts/conway.php|publisher=iht.com|title=The New York Times - Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight Jews were tortured and burned at the stake, and their families forced to convert to Christianity. The bishop of Trento, Johannes Hinderbach, had Simonino canonized and published the first book printed in Trento, ''&quot;Story of a Christian Child Murdered at Trento&quot;'', embellished with 12 woodcuts.&lt;ref name=&quot;iht.com&quot;/&gt; In a governmental ceremony in the 1990s, Trento apologized to the Jewish community for this dark episode and unveiled a plaque commemorating the formal apology.

[[File:Council of Trent.JPG|thumb|right|[[Council of Trent]]]]
In the 16th century, Trento became notable for the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) which gave rise to the [[Counter-Reformation]]. The adjective ''Tridentine'' (as in &quot;Tridentine Mass&quot;) literally means pertaining to Trento, but can also refer to that specific event. Among the notable prince-bishops of this time were [[Bernardo Clesio]] (who governed the city from 1514 to 1539, and managed to steer the Council to Trento) and [[Cristoforo Madruzzo]] (who governed from 1539 to 1567), both able European politicians and Renaissance [[humanism|humanists]], who greatly expanded and embellished the city.

During this period, and as an expression of this Humanism, Trento was also known as the site of a [[Jewish]] printing press. In 1558 Cardinal Madruzzo granted the privilege of printing [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Rabbinic literature|books]] to Joseph Ottolengo, a German [[rabbi]]. The actual printer was [[Jacob Marcaria]], a local physician; after his death in 1562, the activity of the press of Riva di Trento ceased. Altogether, 34 works were published in the period from 1558 to 1562, most of them bearing the coat of arms of Madruzzo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=314&amp;letter=R |title=Riva Di Trento: |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince-bishops governed Trento until the Napoleonic era, when it changed hands among various states. Under the [[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss|reorganization of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1802, the Bishopric was secularized and annexed to the [[Habsburg]] territories. The [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] in 1805 ceded Trento to [[Bavaria]], and the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] four years later gave it to Napoleon's [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]].

The population staged armed resistance to French domination. The resistance leader was [[Andreas Hofer]]. During his youth, he lived in Italian Tyrol, where he learned the [[Italian language]]. When Hofer recovered Trento for the Austrians (1809), he was welcomed with enthusiasm by the population of Trento. Approximately 4,000 Trentinian volunteers (''Sìzzeri'' or ''Schützen'') died in battle against the French and Bavarian troops. In 1810, Hofer was captured and brought to [[Mantua]], and was shot by French soldiers on the express order of Napoleon.

With Napoleon's defeat in 1814, Trento was again annexed by the [[Habsburg Empire]]. Church government was finally extinguished, and Trento was henceforth governed by the secular administration of [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]. In the following decades, Trento experienced a modernization of administration and economy with the first railroad in the Adige valley opening in 1859.  The entire Mediterranean basin was at risk of malaria, a factor that affected the entire Italian peninsula and this Alpine region was not spared. Even Tuscany was particularly hard hit; malaria existed far inland into the Veneto area, reaching the Italian Alps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 3340992 | pmid=22550561 | doi=10.4084/MJHID.2012.016 | volume=4 | title=Short history of malaria and its eradication in Italy with short notes on the fight against the infection in the mediterranean basin | year=2012 | journal=Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis | page=e2012016 | author=Majori G}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1918 to 1940, government figures show Italy's malaria deaths decreased by 96%, due to the efforts of the Rockefeller Foundation and Italy's own malaria experts, who themselves were international leaders in malariology.&lt;ref&gt;http://rockarch.org/publications/resrep/hall.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th century, Trento and [[Trieste]], cities with ethnic Italian majorities still belonging to the Austrians, became icons of the Italian [[irredentist]] movement. [[Benito Mussolini]] briefly joined the staff of a local newspaper in 1909, but left Trento because they could not create an anti-Austrian group.

[[File:Monumento a Cesare Battisti tre.jpg|thumb|left|Mausoleum of [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]]]]The nationalist cause led Italy into [[World War I]]. Damiano Chiesa and the deputy in the Austrian parliament [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]] were two well-known local irredentists who had joined the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian Army]] to fight against Austria-Hungary with the aim of bringing the territory of Trento into the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. The two men were taken prisoners at the nearby southern front. They were put on trial for high treason and executed in the courtyard of [[Castello del Buonconsiglio]].

The region was greatly affected during the war, and some of its fiercest battles were fought on the surrounding mountains. After [[World War I]], Trento and its Italian-speaking province, along with [[Bolzano]] (Bozen) and the part of Tyrol that stretched south of the Alpine watershed (which was primarily [[German language|German]]-speaking), were annexed by Italy.

In 1943, Mussolini was deposed and Italy surrendered to the Allies, who had invaded southern Italy via Sicily. German troops promptly invaded northern Italy and the provinces of Trento, [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]] and [[South Tyrol]] became part of the [[Operation Zone of the Alpine Foothills]], annexed to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Some German-speakers wanted revenge upon Italian-speakers living in the area, but were mostly prevented by the occupying German troops, who still considered Mussolini head of the [[Italian Social Republic]] and wanted to preserve good relations with the Italians. From November 1944 to April 1945, Trento was bombed as part of the so-called &quot;Battle of the Brenner&quot;. War supplies from Germany to support the [[Gothic Line]] were for the most part routed through the rail line through the Brenner Pass. Over 6,849 sorties were flown over targets from [[Verona]] to the [[Brenner Pass]], with 10,267 tons of bombs dropped. Parts of the city were hit by the Allied bombings, including the church of S. Maria Maggiore, the Church of the Annunciation and several bridges over the [[Adige]] river. In spite of the bombings, most of the medieval and renaissance city center was spared. It was finally liberated on 3 May 1945.

In 1947, Trento became the host of the [[Rally Stella Alpina]].

Since the 1950s, the region has enjoyed prosperous growth, thanks in part to its special autonomy from the central Italian government.

On 4 August 2015, the cathedral tower caught fire by &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot;. The clock stopped at 10:50 AM, a matter of minutes after the fire began.

== Economy ==
[[File:Pergola trentino.JPG|thumb|left|Vineyard in Trento]]The city owes much of its unique economy to its position along the main communication route between Italy and Northern Europe and to the Adige river which, prior to its diversion in the mid-19th century, ran through the center of the city. The Adige river was formerly a navigable river and one of the main commercial routes in the Alps. The original course of the river is now covered by the Via Torre Vanga, Via Torre Verde and the Via Alessandro Manzoni.

As late as World War II, Trento [[Trento DOC|depended on wine-making]] and silk.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 40:224.&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturing industry installed in the post-war period has been mostly dismantled. Today, Trento thrives on commerce, services, tourism, high-quality agriculture and food industry (including wine, fruit), as a research and conference center thanks to a small but renowned [[University of Trento|university]]
and internationally renowned research centers such as ''Fondazione Bruno Kessler'' [http://www.fbk.eu], active in both fundamental and applied research, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110905083415/http://isig.fbk.eu/it/home Italian-German Historical Institute], the Centre for Computational and Systems Biology [http://www.cosbi.eu] and ECT* [http://www.ectstar.eu], active in theoretical nuclear studies and part of FBK, and as logistics and transportation thoroughfare.

Valued pink and white [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] is still excavated from some surrounding areas (Pila). This stone can be seen in many of Trento's buildings, both new and old.

The city has two long-running annual sporting events: the [[Giro al Sas]] (a {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} professional road running competition) was first held in the city in 1907 and continues to the present,&lt;ref name=Storia&gt;[http://www.sportrentino.it/portale/novitast/pagina.asp?pid=8 Un balzo nel passato] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722055434/http://www.sportrentino.it/portale/novitast/pagina.asp?pid=8 |date=22 July 2011 }} {{it icon}}.

===Economy Festival Trento===
The Economy festival (Festival dell’Economia di Trento) has been brought into being in 2006 in order to enable and facilitate discussions between economists and a broad public. The aim of this festival is to put the economic terminology across to everyone. The Festival dell’Economia di Trento takes place every year at the end of May on the historic Palazzi of the old town in Trento. 
Well known economists explain and interpret current economy issues, both from a economic-scientific as well as from a social and entrepreneurial viewpoint. In the course of the last years, numerous economy scholars and managers such as Sir [[Anthony Atkinson]], [[Fan Gang]], [[Zygmunt Bauman]] and the Nobel Prize winner [[Gary Becker]] took an active part in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trentino.com/en/highlights/tradition-and-culture/economy-festival-trento/|title=Economy Festival Trento|publisher=trentino.com|accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino===
In 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of [[Tyrol]] and the Italian autonomous provinces of [[South Tyrol]] and [[Trentino]] by recognizing the creation of the [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]].

== Main sights ==
[[File:Museo Diocesano Tridentino.jpg|thumb|right|[[Trento Cathedral|Duomo]]]]
[[File:20110727 Trento Buonconsiglio Castle 6609.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buonconsiglio Castle]]]]
[[File:Palazzo pretorio di Trento.jpg|thumb|right|Palazzo pretorio]]
Although off the beaten path of mass tourism, Trento offers rather interesting monuments. Its architecture has a unique feel, with both Italian Renaissance and Germanic influences. The city center is small, and most Late-Medieval and Renaissance buildings have been restored to their original pastel colours and wooden balconies. Part of the medieval city walls is still visible in Piazza Fiera, along with a circular tower. Once, these walls encircled the entire city and were connected to the Castello del Buonconsiglio.
The main monuments of the city include:
* '''''[[Trento Cathedral|Duomo]]''''' (Cathedral of [[Saint Vigilius]]), a Romanesque-Gothic cathedral of the twelfth-thirteenth century, built on top of a late-Roman basilica (viewable in an underground crypt).
* '''''Piazza Duomo''''', on the side of the cathedral, with frescoed Renaissance buildings and the Late Baroque Fountain of Neptune (''Fontana di Nettuno'') built in 1767–1768.
* '''[[Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Trento|Church of Santa Maria Maggiore]]''' (1520), site of the preparatory congregations of the Third Council of Trent (April 1562 – December 1563). It was built for Bishop [[Bernardo Clesio]] by the architect Antonio Medaglia in Renaissance-Gothic style. The façade has a notable 16th-century portal, while the interior has works by [[Giambettino Cignaroli]] and [[Gian Battista Moroni|Moroni]].
* '''''Castello del Buonconsiglio''''' ('''[[Buonconsiglio Castle]]'''), which includes a museum and the notable Torre dell'Aquila, with a cycle of fine Gothic frescoes depicting the months, commissioned by the prince-bishop Georg von Lichtenstein.
* '''Church of San Pietro''' (12th century) It has a neo-Gothic façade added in 1848–1850.
* '''Church of Sant'Apollinare''', erected in the 13th century at the feet of the Doss Trento hill.
* '''Church of San Lorenzo''' (12th century). It has a Romanesque apse.
* '''''Torre Verde''''' ('''Green Tower'''), along the former transit path of the [[Adige]] river, is said to be where persons executed in the name of the Prince-Bishop were deposited in the river.
* '''''[[Palazzo delle Albere]]''''' ('''Palace of the Trees'''), a Renaissance villa next to the Adige river built around 1550 by the Madruzzo family, now hosting a modern art museum.
* '''''Palazzo Pretorio''''', next to the Duomo, of the 12th century, with a bell tower (''Torre Civica'') of the thirteenth century (it now hosts a collection of baroque paintings of religious themes). It was the main Bishops' residence until the mid-13th century.
* '''''[[Palazzo Salvadori]]''''' (1515).
* '''''Palazzo Geremia''''' (late 15th century). It has a Renaissance exterior and Gothic interiors.
* '''''Palazzo Lodron''''', built during the Council of Trent. The interior has a large fresco cycle.
* Various underground remains of the streets and villas of the Roman city (in Via Prepositura and Piazza Cesare Battisti).

Trento also sports  [[modernist]] architecture, including the train station and the central post office, both by rationalist architect [[Angiolo Mazzoni]]. In particular, the train station (1934–36) is considered a landmark building of Italian railways architecture and combines many varieties of local stone with the most advanced building materials of the time: glass, reinforced concrete, metal. The post office was once decorated with colored windows by [[Fortunato Depero]], but these were destroyed during bombings in World War II. Other buildings of that time include the Grand Hotel (by G. Lorenzi) with some guest rooms furnished with futurist furniture by Depero, and the &quot;R. Sanzio&quot; Primary School built in 1931–34 and designed by [[Adalberto Libera]].

'''Aquila Basket Trento''', also known for sponsorship reasons as '''Dolomiti Energia Trento''', is an Italian professional [[basketball]] club based in [[Trento|Trent]], [[Trentino]].

It was founded in 1995 as an amalgamation of two local clubs, going from the amateur divisions to the first division [[Lega Basket Serie A|LBA]] in less than a decade. It plays in the LBA as of the [[2017–18 Lega Basket Serie A|2017–18 season]].

==History==
Aquila Basket Trento was founded in 1995 from the merger of two clubs playing the seventh tier Serie D, Dolomiti Sport B.C. Trento and Pallacanestro Villazzano, under the impetus of their respective presidents; Gianni Brusinelli and Marco Angelini.
In 2000, Giovanni Zobele became club president and the same season Aquila Basket was promoted to the Serie C2, later moving up to the Serie C1 in 2002.&lt;ref name=Storia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aquilabasket.it/page/341827768423/storia |title=Storia |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=AquilaBasket.it  |access-date=31 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long serving coach [[Maurizio Buscaglia]] was nominated before the 2003–04 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/sport/basket/2014/06/13/news/trento_festeggia_promozione-88781275/ |title=Basket, Trento si prende la A: ''Non siamo impreparati'' |last=Apicella |first=Nicola |date=13 June 2014 |website=[[la Repubblica|Repubblica]].it |access-date=31 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Basketball, Trento grabs the [Serie] A: “We are not unprepared”}}&lt;/ref&gt; he would help the club win the C1 the next season to be promoted to the fourth Serie B2, adding the [[Italian LNP Cup|C1 Cup]] with a 77–68 win over [[Basket Ferentino|Navarra Ferentino]].&lt;ref name=Storia /&gt;&lt;ref name=ECprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocupbasketball.com/eurocup/news/i/68uexbbdeamvit4w |title=Club profile: Dolomiti Energia Trento |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=3 August 2015 |website=[[EuroCup Basketball|EurocupBasketball]].com  |access-date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Staying there for four years, it lost the promotion playoffs on game 5 in 2005–06, with Buscaglia leaving the following season.
Trento won the 2007–08 regular season but could not obtain promotion to the [[Serie B Basket|Divisione Nazionale A]] until buying Lumezzane's sporting rights in 2009.&lt;ref name=Storia /&gt;&lt;ref name=ECprofile /&gt;

For the club's first season in the third division, [[Vincenzo Esposito]] – notable for his playing career - was chosen for the coaching job, leading the club to the ninth place. Buscaglia returned to Trento in 2010, guiding the side to eighth in the league, though that meant it had to play in the relegation playoffs as the league was contracting, with their subsequent loss condemning them to relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trentinocorrierealpi.gelocal.it/sport/2011/06/07/news/il-bitumcalor-riparte-da-buscaglia-1.3968915 |title=Il Bitumcalor riparte da Buscaglia |last=Peretti |first=Daniele |date=7 June 2011 |website=TrentinoCorriere delle Alpi.it |access-date=6 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Bitumcalor restarts with Buscaglia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Trento -  having earlier confirmed Busacaglia - was granted a wildcard by the league to stay at that level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladige.it/sport/2011/06/13/ripescaggio-ufficiale-laquila-resta |title=Ripescaggio ufficiale L'Aquila resta in A |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=13 June 2011 |website=[[Alto Adige (newspaper)|L'Adige]].it |access-date= |language= |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January 2012, Luigi Longhi replaced Zobele as president. In the course of the same 2011–12 season, Trento earned a promotion to the [[Serie A2 Basket|LegaDue]] after beating  [[Pallacanestro Chieti|BLS Chieti]] on 27 May 2012 to win the semifinals series 3-1, they went on to win the league outright after toppling Ferentino in the final. Trento adapted quickly to the professional second division, lifting the [[Italian LNP Cup|LegaDue Cup]] – organised in the PalaTrento - by beating  [[Pistoia Basket 2000|Pistoia]] 84–76 in the final, also reaching the promotion playoffs that same season. In 2013–14 it went one better, finishing the regular season in first place before downing [[Fortitudo Agrigento|Agrigento]] (3–0) [[Auxilium CUS Torino|Torino]] (3–2) and finally [[Orlandina Basket|Capo d'Orlando]] (3–0) to earn a historic promotion to the first division [[Lega Basket Serie A|Serie A]].&lt;ref name=Storia /&gt;

Their first season in the elite was an unanticipated success as the promotees, led by Serie A MVP Tony Mitchell (also league top scorer), finished fourth in the regular season whilst the organisation had two other awardees at the [[Lega Basket Serie A Awards|Lega Basket Awards]], with  Buscaglia coach of the year and [[General manager (sports)|GM]] Salvatore Trainotti best executive (repeating the LegaDue awards they earned in 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazzettadellevalli.it/sport/basket-lega-awars-2015-pioggia-di-premi-su-trento-mitchell-mvp-di-serie-a1-trainotti-dirigente-dellanno-buscaglia-coach-of-the-year-47270/ |title=Basket, Lega Awars 2015: pioggia di premi su Trento, Mitchell MVP di serie A1, Trainotti dirigente dell’anno, Buscaglia coach of the year |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=8 May 2015 |website=GazzettadelleValli.it |access-date=31 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Basketball, Lega Awards 2015: heap of awards for Trento, Mitchell Serie A MVP, Trainotti executive of the year, Buscaglia coach of the year}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qualifying for the title playoffs for their first season in the elite, Trento won the first game of the quarterfinal series against [[Dinamo Basket Sassari|Dinamo Banco di Sardegna Sassari]] 81–70 for another record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Basket/SerieA/18-05-2015/basket-playoff-serie-a-quarti-gara-1-milano-bologna-90-67-corso-trento-sassari-110881994321.shtml |title=Basket, playoff Serie A, quarti gara-1: Milano-Bologna 90-67, Trento-Sassari 81-70 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 18 May 2015 |website=[[La Gazzetta dello Sport|Gazzetta]].it  |access-date=31 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Basketball, Serie A playoffs, quarterfinals game 1: Milano-Bologna 90-67, Trento-Sassari 81-70}}&lt;/ref&gt; but could not make their home advantage count as they then lost a closely contested game at the PalaTrento before being defeated in both away games to the eventual champions.&lt;ref name=ECprofile /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/sport/basket/2015/05/24/news/play_off_sassari_elimina_trento-115176238/ |title=Basket, play off: Sassari si regala Milano, finisce la favola di Trento |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=24 May 2015 |website=[[la Repubblica|Repubblica]].it |access-date=31 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Basketball, playoffs: Sassari treat themselves to Milano, Trento's fairytale is over}}&lt;/ref&gt;
That result did ensure the side would participate in a European competition for the first time ever, earning a place in the second-tier [[EuroCup Basketball|EuroCup]] for [[2015–16 Eurocup Basketball|2015–16]]. The club reached the semi-finals in the competition.

In the 2016–17 season, Trento reached the Italian League Finals for the first time in club history after beating [[Pallacanestro Olimpia Milano|Olimpia Milano]] in the semi-finals series 4–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/en/legabasket/458452/trento-disgraced-milano-advanced-finals/|title=Trento disgraced Milano and advanced to the finals|publisher=Eurohoops.net|date=2017-06-02|accessdate=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Catholic '''Archdiocese of Trento''' ({{lang-la|Archidioecesis Tridentina}}, German '''Trient'''), in the [[Triveneto]], is a Latin Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese named after its see in Alpine Italy, [[Trento]] (Tr(i)ent), in [[Trentino-Alto Adige]] region.

Its [[cathedral]] episcopal see is the [[Minor basilica]] Cattedrale di S. Vigilio Vescovo in, Trento. It has two more minor basilicas: 
* Basilica S. Maria Maggiore Basilica S. Maria Maggiore, also in Trento city
* Basilica di Ss. Sisinio, Martirio e Alessandro, in [[Sanzeno]], Trento.

== History ==
Established circa 200 AD as '''Diocese of Trento''', it became a [[suffragan]] of the Patriarchs of Aquiliea-Grado. As a [[prince-bishopric]], the bishop's temporal possession also constituted a state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. At some point, it was added to the province of [[Archdiocese of Salzburg|Salzburg]].

In 1786 it gained territory from the [[Diocese of Feltre]].

On 14 June 1929 it was promoted to '''[[Archdiocese]] of Trento''', which only became a [[metropolitan see]] on 6 August 1964, with the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bolzano-Brixen|Diocese of Bolzano-Brixen]] as its only [[suffragan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dtrei.html ''Catholic Hierarchy'' page]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 July 1964 it lost territory to the then [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brixen|Diocese of Brixen]] (Bressanone).

It enjoyed papal visits from [[Pope John Paul II]] in July 1988 and April 1995.

'''Cassa Centrale Banca - Credito Cooperativo del Nord Est S.p.A.''' is a central institute of the cooperative banks (rural credit union) of Trentino, based in [[Trento]], Trentino. Some cooperative banks (rural credit union) of Veneto and Friuli – Venezia Giulia also joined.
==History==
In 2017 the central institution applied to be one of the central bank for proposed [[co-operative banking]] groups of whole Italy.&lt;ref name=2017bankinggroup&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.cassacentrale.it/ccbcontent0.jsp?XD=5671&amp;LANGUAGE=IT|title=CASSA CENTRALE BANCA PRESENTA LA CANDIDATURA A CAPOGRUPPO|date=30 January 2017|access-date=17 July 2017|publisher=Cassa Centrale Banca|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other candidate was [[ICCREA Banca]] (and [[Raiffeisen Landesbank Südtirol – Cassa Centrale Raiffeisen dell'Alto Adige]] for South Tyrol autonomous province only). A new Italian law required all co-operative banks of Italy to join a banking group, which the central institution has power to recapitalize individual member banks, but the central institution itself would be owned by the member banks in a majority. Cassa Centrale Banca - Credito Cooperativo del Nord Est had proposed to change their name to Cassa Centrale Banca – Credito Cooperativo Italiano.&lt;ref name=2017bankinggroup/&gt;

==Joint ventures==
Cassa Centrale Banca had a joint venture &quot;Casse Rurali – Raiffeisen Finanziaria&quot; with its [[Raiffeisen Landesbank Südtirol – Cassa Centrale Raiffeisen dell'Alto Adige|South Tyrol counterpart]]. The joint venture was the largest shareholder of [[Investitionsbank Trentino Südtirol – Mediocredito Trentino Alto Adige|Investitionsbank  – Mediocredito]] of South Tyrol - Trentino autonomous region.

Cassa Centrale Banca had another joint venture Nord Est Asset Management S.A. (NEAM in short).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cassacentrale.it/wwwhome1.jsp?XD=3302&amp;LANGUAGE=IT|title= NORD EST FUND |access-date=17 July 2017|publisher=Cassa Centrale Banca|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Shareholders==
The bank was owned by the member banks directly. However, in order to sell 25% shares to [[DZ Bank]], a new holding company '''Centrale Finanziaria del Nord Est''' was established in 2007, in order to make the member banks had a controlling influence to the central institute.

'''Mediocredito Trentino – Alto Adige''' ({{lang-de|Investitionsbank Trentino Südtirol}}) is an Italian investment bank based in [[Trento]], Trentino. The bank served historically the autonomous provinces of Trentino and South Tyrol, but now extended to Lombardy (Brescia), Veneto (Treviso and Padua) and Emilia-Romagna (Bologna).
==History==
'''Istituto per l'Esercizio del Credito a Medio e Lungo Termine nella Regione Trentino – Alto Adige''' ('''Mediocredito Trentino – Alto Adige''' in short) was found in 1953 as a [[statutory corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:1953-03-13;208|title=Legge N°208/1953|date=13 March 1953|access-date=1 April 2016|publisher=Normattiva|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time banks were separated from providing short term loan and medium and loan term loan, which several Mediocredito was set up to enhance the post war recovery. The Ministry of the Treasury provided 800 million [[Italian lira|lire]] (54%) and Trentino – South Tyrol Region 450 million lire (36%). Due to [[Legge Amato]] the bank became a [[Società per Azioni]] (limited company), with a share capital of 66.240 [[1,000,000,000|billion]] lire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/1992/08/25/092A3950/sg|title=Approvazione del progetto di ristrutturazione presentato dal Mediocredito Trentino – Alto Adige|date=25 August 1992|access-date=1 April 2016|author=Ministry of the Treasury|publisher=Italian Republic Official Gazette|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later increased to 112,470,400,000 lire, or €58,484,608.

'''The Palio of Districts of Trento''' (in Italian: ''Il palio delle Contrade di Trento'') is a celebration in remembrance of the [[Battle of Calliano (1487)]] and takes place every year in September in the city of [[Trento]], the capital of [[Trentino]] in [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], a region of Northern Italy.

== Historical origin ==
The [[Palio]] is celebrated to remember the victory of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Battle of Calliano (1487)|Battle of Calliano]], which ensued on the 10th August 1487 between the forces of the [[Republic of Venice]] and the combined forces of the [[Bishopric of Trent|Prince-Bishopric of Trento]] and of the [[County of Tyrol|County of Tirol]] in the hands of [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Sigismund of Habsburg]], Archduke of [[Austria]] and ruler of [[County of Tyrol|Tirol]] from 1446 to 1490.

The forces of Trento and Tirol managed to defeat the soldiers of the [[Republic of Venice]], under the command of [[Roberto Sanseverino d'Aragona]] (who died in the conflict) in the municipality of [[Pomarolo]], near [[Calliano, Trentino|Calliano]] and [[Rovereto]] and 15 kilometres far from Trento.

== Program ==
The [[Palio]] of Districts of Trento consists in three days of festivity in the month of September, during which the eight districts (in Italian: ''[[Contrada|contrade]]'') of Trento engage in archery competitions. The tree-day festival is introduced by ''Il Corteggio'' (in English: The Court) and ''L'investitura dell'arciere'' (in English: The Investiture of the Archer) and ends with the delivery of ''La Feretra Imperiale'' to the archer of the winning District.

=== The Court ===

This event precedes the start of the celebrations and is a procession, in which around 500 people parade along the streets of the city centre, wearing medieval clothing representing the eight districts of Trento.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amicitta.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=9|title=Il Corteggio|last=|first=|date=|website=Palio delle Contrade. Associazione Culturale Amici della Città Trento|publisher=|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Investiture of the Archer ===

The Investiture of the Archer occurs the day before the start of the Palio. In this occasion, each participating archer has to swear publicly in Piazza Duomo to be loyal to their own district. In turn, the archers receive the title of archer, their chosen battle name, the Tallero Stretto (official coin of the Palio) and three arrows to be used in the archery competitions.

This ceremony is officiated by a city official (usually the Mayor of Trento) and by the Prior of the Districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amicitta.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=10|title=L'investitura dell'arciere|last=|first=|date=|website=Palio delle Contrade. Associazione Culturale Amici della Città Trento|publisher=|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archery competitions ===

The archers of the different districts face both ability and velocity trials from 15 meters. The final trial is contended by the three archers, who have achieved the highest scores in the first two trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amicitta.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61&amp;Itemid=30|title=Le prove dell'arciere|last=|first=|date=|website=Palio delle Contrade. Associazione Culturale Amici della Città Trento|publisher=|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Imperial Feretra ===

The archer who wins the final trial obtains the Feretra Imperiale, the Palio, which is bestowed upon him by the Mayor of Trento.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amicitta.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=14|title=Il Palio (la feretra Imperiale)|last=|first=|date=|website=Palio delle Contrade. Associazione Culturale Amici della Città Trento|publisher=|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional events ===

In the course of the festival, there are usually additional events, such as:
* &lt;u&gt;Medieval Arts and Professions special Fair&lt;/u&gt;: a fair where medieval professions and skills are shown by local artisans and artists, who wear medieval clothing for the occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.trentoblog.it/palio-delle-contrade-2012-trento-dal-7-al-9-settembre/|title=PALIO DELLE CONTRADE 2012 Trento – Dal 7 al 9 settembre|last=|first=|date=|work=Blog|access-date=October 8, 2016|via=Trentoblog.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eventiesagre.it/Eventi_Storici/1702_Palio+delle+Contrade+Citta+di+Trento.html|title=15° Palio delle Contrade Città di Trento Rivistazione storica medioevale|last=|first=|date=|work=Portal about events|access-date=|via=Eventiesagre.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;Photographic Contest for Amateurs&lt;/u&gt;: a contest on a different topic for each edition of the Palio.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amicitta.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=8|title=Concorsi Fotografici|last=|first=|date=|website=Palio delle Contrade.

== Districts ==
The districts involved in the Palio are eight:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amicitta.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=4%3Acatpalio&amp;id=68%3Acenni-storici-delle-contrade&amp;Itemid=25|title=Le contrade della città di Trento|last=|first=|date=|website=Palio delle Contrade.

* &lt;u&gt;Contrada Larga&lt;/u&gt;: it encloses ''Via Belenzani'', ''Via delle Orne'', ''Galleria Tirrena'' and ''Piazza Duomo''. Originally, it was characterised by many towers and small forts. When these were removed, it acquired the present name (in English: Large District) to denote the new look: it was not narrow anymore, but rather wide.
* &lt;u&gt;Contrada San Benedetto&lt;/u&gt;: it encloses ''Via Oss Mazurana'', ''Piazza Pasi'', ''Piazza C. Battisti'', ''Via Diaz'', ''Passaggio San Benedetto'' and ''Via Malpaga''. Its name refers to the now disappeared Church of San Benedetto and it was given in the [[13th century|13th Century]].
* &lt;u&gt;Contrada degli Orevesi&lt;/u&gt;: it encloses ''Via S. Pietro'', ''Piazzetta Anfiteatro'' and ''Vicolo degli Orbi''. In the past this was a district in which the majority of the shops were owned by ''orevesi'' (in English: goldsmiths). It was also known as the District of S. Pietro, due to the ''Church of San Pietro''.
* &lt;u&gt;Contrada del Macello Vecchio&lt;/u&gt;: it encloses ''Via Mantova'', ''Largo Carducci'', ''Via del Simonino'' and ''Via Galileo Galilei''. It is called District of the Old Slaughterhouse because in ''Largo Carducci'', (also known as Piazza del Macello), the slaughter was carried out and the nearby shops were mostly owned by butchers.
* &lt;u&gt;Contrada Todesca&lt;/u&gt;: it encloses ''Via del Suffragio'', ''Via San Marco and'' ''Piazza della Mostra''. Its name, German District, is due to the fact that this part of the city was occupied by German people. 
* &lt;u&gt;Contrada Santa Maria Maddalena&lt;/u&gt;: it encloses ''Via S. M. Maddalena'', ''Via Livio Marchetti'', ''Via Dietro Le Mura B'', ''Via F. Ferruccio'', ''Vicolo S. Maria Maddalena''. Its name refers to the now disappeared Church of Santa Maria Maddalena.
* &lt;u&gt;Contrada Santa Maria&lt;/u&gt;: it encloses ''Via Cavour'', ''Piazza S. M. Maggiore'', ''Via Prepositura'', ''Via delle Orfane'', ''Via Torre Vanga, Via Zanella'', ''Piazza Lainez'' and ''Via Pozzo''. This district was also called District of the Orphans due to the presence of an Orphanage, which was at first dedicated to both males and females. Later on, though, it was for female orphans exclusively.
* &lt;u&gt;Borgo Antico San Martino&lt;/u&gt;: it encloses ''Via S. Martino'', ''Via Torre d'Augusto'', ''Largo N. Sauro'', ''Via Malvasia'', ''Via Manzoni'' and ''Piazza R. Sanzio''. It takes its name from the Church of San Martino.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8570">The '''Church of Santa Maria Maggiore''' is an important place of worship in the city of [[Trento]], and the site of the Third Session of the Council of Trent. It was built by [[Antonio Medaglia]] on the model of the [[Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua|basilica of Sant’Andrea]] in Mantua, at the wish of the Prince-Archbishop [[Bernardo Clesio]].&lt;ref&gt;Annali, overo croniche di Trento cive historie contenenti le prodezze de duci Trentini, li origine della citta di Trento ... gli accrescimenti fatti del cardinale Bernardo Clesio. - Trento, Zanetto 1648 p.390&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1973 [[Pope Paul VI]] accorded it the status of minor cathedral.

== Founding, Development and History ==
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Chiesa di Santa Maria Maggiore (Trento).jpg|Church of Santa Maria Maggiore (Trento)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Trento - Santa Maria Maggiore.JPG|thumb|Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Trento]]
Traditionally, the foundation of the cathedral was attributed to [[Vigilius of Trent|St. Vigilius]], the third Bishop of Trento, in the late fourth of early fifth century, but archaeological investigations between 1974 and 1978 and again in 2007–2009 have cast further light on the story of the building. In the Roman period, there were public buildings, including a public baths, on the site where the cathedral was later built.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Baroncioni, La città di Trento tra tardo antico e alto medioevo: la genesi della città medievale e lo spazio del sacro, tesi di Dottorato in Archeologia, Università di Bologna, 2012 p.91&lt;/ref&gt; The original cathedral itself was built somewhat later than previously thought, in the late fifth or early sixth century, and had a large space divided into three naves. The [[chancel]] of this church, which was still in use towards the end of the tenth and eleventh centuries, contains traces of an [[opus sectile]] pavement dating to late antiquity, which was later replaced with a mosaic from the middle of the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Fasti Online, ISSN 1828-3179 Il Progetto di Santa Maria Maggiore (Trento). Relazione Preliminare: dallo scavo alla diffusione dei dati, Maria Teresa Guaitoli http://www.fastionline.org/docs/FOLDER-it-2011-238.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the late eighth and early ninth centuries a number of building works were undertaken on the cathedral, in particular the addition of richly-decorated stone liturgical fittings, including a rood screen and a ciborium. In the late tenth or early eleventh centuries the old church was demolished, and its structure, including the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] fittings, were used as building materials for a new church, smaller than the previous one. It had a semicircular central apse with two side-apses.
[[File:Trento - Santa Maria Maggiore 05.JPG|thumb|Door of Santa Maria Maggiore]]
Evidence from a find of coins indicates that after 1290 a third church was built on the site of the previous one. This one had two naves ending in symmetrical apses. This building preserved, among other elements of earlier edifices, fragments of frescoes and parts of a gothic fascicule semi-pillar at one of its entrances.
In 1520, work started on the current church, at the direction of Bernardo Clesio. Between 1899 and 1901 further works and restoration modified the renaissance façade.

Santa Maria Maggiore was the site of the Third Session of the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563).&lt;ref&gt;All Things Made New:The Reformation and Its Legacy, Diarmaid MacCulloch, Oxford University Press, 2016 p.71&lt;/ref&gt;
After archaeological and restoration works, the church reopened to the public in April 2012 and the altar was consecrated on 30 September 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;fidelityhouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.fidelityhouse.eu/viaggi/chiesa-di-santa-maria-maggiore-trento-66538.html|publisher=news.fidelityhouse.eu|title=Chiesa di Santa Maria Maggiore a Trento|accessdate=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
The renaissance church begun in 1520 is built in red and white stone. The main façade consists of an arched entrance in renaissance style with a door commissioned by Prince-Archbishop [[Cristoforo Madruzzo]] in 1539.&lt;ref name=&quot;originalitaly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originalitaly.it/it/editoriali/a-chiesa-di-s--maria-maggiore-a-trento|publisher=originalitaly.it|title=Chiesa di S. Maria Maggiore a Trento :: Gli editoriali di OriginalITALY - OriginalITALY.it - Il meglio in Italia|accessdate=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the door is a [[lunette]] depicting the [[Annunciation]]. The bell tower, 53 metres high, is the tallest in the city. Constructed of white limestone, it has two rows of three-mullioned romanesque windows and a polygonal cupola. Beside the church stands a column erected in 1845 memorialising the celebrations for the third centenary of the opening of the Council of Trent.

The interior of the church consists of a single nave. Along the sides are a series of chapels with marble altars in the baroque style. There are also a series of altarpieces and the baroque sarcophagus containing relics attributed to [[Pope Clement I|Saint Clement]]. Of historical significance also is the series of paintings which depict sense from the Council of Trent and some of the main figures of the [[Counter-reformation]]. The choir is at the north end of the presbytery and consists of a large gallery with [[bas-relief]]s, held up by four finely-worked [[corbel]]s.

== Pipe organ ==
On the chancel of the presbytery there is a Mascioni pipe organ, opus 402m, built in 1928,&lt;ref name=&quot;mascioni-organs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mascioni-organs.com/en/elenco-nuovi|publisher=mascioni-organs.com|title=Elenco Nuovi &amp;#8211; Mascioni Organs|accessdate=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which re-used the casing of the old 1536 organ. It was restored and widened in 1953 following damage during the second world war. The instrument is electrically-powered and has three keyboards, each of 58 notes, 30 pedals, and a total of 58 registers. The casing, with a [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlian]] arch structure, displays the pipes in a single cusp on each side and three cusps in the centre.

[[File:Moser Cicli chrome time trial bicycle (23986133770).jpg|thumb|Moser Cicli [[time trial bicycle]]]]
[[Francesco Moser]] began building [[racing bicycle]]s after his [[retirement]], as did many Italian bicycle racers, in a small workshop in [[Trento]], [[Italy]]. Production is 2,000-3,000 frames annually. 

Moser's frames are unique among Italian racing bicycles for being fillet [[brazing|brazed]] using [[silver solder]] rather than using lugs with brass brazing; silver solder never gets hot enough to weaken the tubing and thus bicycles constructed in this manner do not need to be reinforced with lugs, thus reducing the bicycle's weight. After brazing, each frame is hand filed and aligned on a digital alignment table. The smooth lines resulting from the lack of lugs are emphasized with a unicrown fork and an integrated seatpost, attached by an expander bolt in a manner similar to the handlebar stem.
